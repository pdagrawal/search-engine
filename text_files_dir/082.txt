more
jobs
more
wealth
for
the
elite
more
economic
success
etc
this
couldnt
more
simple
but
truth
take

throw
away
system
which
increases
the
rate
and
amount

from
the
planet
every
year
increases
the
speed
which
these

icke
says
the
perfect

and
yet
the

that
controls
the
world
and
the
minds
its
people
short
for
the
present
system
survive
and
increase
production
every

essential
that
rape
the

and
poison

pollution
this
the
system
supported
every
major
political
movement
the
world
except
for
the
greens
this
the
conventional
wisdom
that
destroying
the
earth
also
our
present
global
system
individual
countries
surrender
control
their
own
destiny
other
countries
produce
cheaper

and
often
new
but
environmentally
and
socially
destructive

which
cant

but
what
those
that
have
jobs
they
spend
most
their
time
working
factories
and
offices
producing
these
trinkets
buy
even
more

the
reality
icke
has
been
able
carry
out
detailed
analysis
which
fits
together
past
and
present
world
events
which
appear
occur
independently
each
other
but
truth
have
the
same
people
pulling
the
strings
all
them
its
becoming
increasingly
true
that
very
few
people
control
the
world
persuading
and
pressuring
the
population
through
fear
think
the
way
they
want
them
act
and
think
preferably
not
act
think
independently
all
currently
four
multinational
corporations
control
the
global
media
explains
what
happens
practice
that
you
look
all
the
dogmas
all
cultures
all
societies
have
what
call
hasslefree
zone
that
area
within
any
culture
within
each
dogma
religious
economic
political
etc
wherein
you
conform
you
are
the
comfort
zone
ones
going
laugh
you
condemn
you
for
being
different
for
expressing
your
uniqueness
because
you
are
locked
into
the
herd
mentality
and
you
are
conforming
what
you
are
told
you
should
and
when
you
step
out
this
mindset
and
express
your
unique
aspect
all
that
exists
and
refuse
frightened
controlled
you
immediately
face
ridicule
condemnation
have
england
his
talks
icke
connects
and
links
conspiracy
ideas
with
the
spiritual
first
explains
how
are
giving
our
minds
away
and
the
means
through
which
are
conditioned
that
discloses
vast
number
names
and
organizations
which
are
very
famous
and
people
who
are
the
controlling
hierarchy
including
the
president
says
not
this
out
condemnation
because
the
people
involved
are
expressing
their
own
state
being
the
time
they
are
also
reflecting
back
the
collective
human
mind
itself
and
the
results
our
own
lack
personal
responsibility
and
integrity
think
that
important
this
first
also
point
out
how
the
same
people
apparently
different
sides
politics
are
actually
connected
the
same
elite
organizations
these
organizations
have
the
same
proven
agenda
world
government
world
central
bank
world
army
world
currency
and
some
say
microchipped
population
these
apparent
opposites
politics
are
there
persuade
that
are
not
living
prison
that
have
choice
yet
these
persons
are
not
opposites
all
but
are
part
oneparty
state
the
last
two
presidents
were
apparently
opposites
and
different
sides
bill
clinton
and
george
bushyet
they
were
both
heavily
involved
within
the
same
elite
organizations
the
media
and
politicians
have
cozy
unwritten
agreement
that
projects
myth
people
which
that
prime
ministers
presidents
and
highranking
politicians
are
the
top
the
decisionmaking
pyramid
the
world
they
then
walk
around
the
world
stage
and
act
they
are
the
final
arbiters
power
the
media
goes
along
with
this
which
means
that
the
echelons
above
the
clintons
who
actually
pull
the
strings
never
get
researched
and
investigated
because
they
are
invisible
the
public
these
are
the
individuals
who
decide
who
becomes
president
because
they
own
the
money
and
the
media
the
president
only
the
most
famous
frontman
the
world
this
also
why
movements
for
social
economic
and
environmental
changes
are
ineffective
they
are
unable
change
the
system
because
they
are
actually
forced
part
the
system
survive
all
their
resources
are
expended
the
frontmen
while
the
real
power
acts
subversively
behind
the
scenes
perpetrate
the
system
now
also
through
nonprofit
foundations
operated
the
elite
many
are
infiltrated
agents
who
turn
the
movements
into
vehicles
promote
the
system
most
activists
attack
the
elements
the
system
they
can
perceive
with
anger
blame
and
often
violence
from
spiritual
perspective
only
possible
transform
the
negative
consciousness
the
system
with
love
and
compassion
this
why
necessary
this
time
move
higher
state
consciousness
solve
our
world
problems
mass
mindcontrolling
technique
which
used
these
elite
organizations
all
the
time
the
problemreactionsolution
problem
covertly
created
the
cia
kgb
etc
and
someone
blamed
for
the
problem
the
culprit
might
war
run
the
currency
national
debt
government
collapse
can
anything
the
media
used
stimulate
public
opinion
relationship
the
created
problem
that
the
public
cries
out
something
must
done
that
point
those
who
created
the
problem
openly
offer
the
solution
means
getting
what
they
wanted
all
along
example
this
icke
explains
the
world
army
scenario
the
last
thing
that
the
problemreactionsolution
needed
bosnia
was
effective
peacekeeping
operation
was
effective
would
have
been
rwanda
and
somalia
but
then
there
would
problem
solve
result
the
peacekeeping
operation
not
working
there
continued
problem
the
peacekeeping
was
designed
not
work
and
was
aided
the
major
peace
negotiators
bosnia
who
incidentally
are
all
members
the
same
elite
organizations
that
have
agenda
the
creation
world
army
the
more
horrific
the
pictures
that
came
out
bosnia
the
louder
came
the
public
outcry
something
must
done
this
was
understandable
from
the
publics
point
view
but
the
solution
put
forward
was
the
formation
what
effectively
world
army
man
force
the
largest
multinational
force
assembled
since
world
war
and
exactly
what
the
conspirators
wanted
icke
operates
two
different
levels
the
hereandnow
the
conspiratorial
research
level
assess
what
actually
taking
place
and
the
spiritual
which
demonstrates
that
you
take
your
mind
away
there
are
physical
consequences
says
take
our
personal
and
spiritual
power
back
stop
being
herd
sheep
and
express
our
unique
divine
individuality
then
the
ability
few
control
our
world
disappears
once
people
realize
they
can
control
their
own
lives
that
their
own
power
exists
within
them
rather
than
outside
themselves
the
game
over
for
the
global
elite
you
dont
need
gun
you
dont
need
another
political
party
you
dont
need
another
smokefilled
room
protest
group
rally
all
you
need
celebrate
your
uniqueness
delink
from
the
robotic
herd
mentality
and
respect
everybodys
right
the
same
suddenly
have
removed
the
energy
vehicle
through
which
global
conspiracy
can
operateour
herd
mentality
icke
has
also
been
working
extensively
with
what
calls
earth
energies
and
has
travelled
peru
canada
africa
and
over
much
europe
especially
britain
doing
planetary
healing
work
explains
are
the
custodians
mother
earth
and
have
access
higher
consciousness
can
act
facilitators
heal
and
balance
many
the
disturbances
the
earth
through
grid
system
known
ley
lines
and
power
spots
these
power
spots
act
like
acupuncture
points
the
earths
surface
and
the
ley
lines
meridians
and
are
easily
disrupted
acts
violence
war
toxic
pollution
construction
etc
have
the
ability
work
with
higher
consciousness
heal
and
balance
the
earth
when
asked
where
got
all
his
information
icke
explained
many
people
within
government
and
intelligence
agencies
well
the
military
have
known
for
long
time
what
going
but
have
not
known
what
with
the
information
they
are
choosing
give
because
they
know
that
will
put
out
into
the
world
keep
saying
people
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
that
consciousness
moves
another
timespace
reality
and
thats
the
absolute
worst
thing
that
could
happen
this
fear
death
probably
the
most
effective
means
control
the
conspirators
have
the
truth
