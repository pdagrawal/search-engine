certain
times
each
month
are
poor
times
make
major
decisions
purchases
these
are
the
times
when
your
purchases
turn
out
something
you
never
wear
use
they
are
also
disastrous
times
hold
important
meetings
when
the
moon
void
course
become
like
floating
balloons
helium
and
cant
trust
our
decisionmaking
skills
because
are
not
grounded
whatever
initiate
during
these
times
tends
not
fulfill
its
purpose
keep
eye
the
times
listed
this
column
during
these
times
dont
begin
anything
important
dont
make
major
purchases
dont
make
important
plans
expect
shortages
delays
and
goofups
pacific
standard
