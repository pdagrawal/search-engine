recovery
and
the
art
movement
mike
santry
its
good
seeker
but
sooner
later
you
have
finder
and
then
well
give
what
you
have
found
gift
into
the
world
for
whoever
will
accept
jonathan

some
people
through
life
seeking
and
never
finding
others
seek
find
and
then
assist
others
their
own
quests
barbara
mindell
started
her
search
shortly
after
car
crash
the
age
left
her
paraplegic
while
one
the
hospital
told
her
she
would
never
walk
again
was
the
impression
she
was
left
with
never
really
bought
the
idea
that
never
walk
she
says
there
was
god
there
was
possibility
that
could
recover
from
this
injury
conventional
north
american
medical
wisdom
didnt
have
the
answers
she
was
looking
for
doctors
think
about
the
human
body
one
would
car
machine
once
grown
doesnt
grow
regenerate
eventually
falls
apart
and
they
just
fix
the
parts
along
the
way
she
says
mindell
spent
the
next
ten
years
exploring
the
alternative
healing
methods
including
bodywork
massage
and
acupuncture
she
sent
out
form
letters
health
and
scientific
organizations
around
the
world
asking
people
work
with
her
she
received
nothing
more
than
good
wishes
reply
the
course
her
search
mindell
met
emilie
conraddaoud
and
was
introduced
continuumsomething
she
describes
primary
movement
process
which
explores
movement
something
are
rather
than
something
conraddaoud
invented
and
developed
this
process
which
mindell
says
everchanging
everevolving
inquiry
into
the
nature
what
means
human
being
mindell
learned
from
conraddaoud
breathe
manner
that
created
wavelike
motion
generated
from
the
part
her
body
that
could
move
the
wave
motion
radiates
through
the
body
spreading
tiny
movements
and
signaling
dormant
areas
participate
the
concept
has
been
described
breaking
ice
get
water
mindell
suggests
entertain
the
notion
that
are
open
systems
with
endless
possibilities
for
innovation
and
the
development
new
neural
pathways
new
connections
new
ways
identify
ourselves
she
describes
her
experience
with
the
continuum
having
been
way
transform
herself
its
like
entering
into
new
life
shedding
old
skinand
doing
loving
environment
she
says
conraddaoud
teaches
that
human
beings
develop
aquatic
atmosphere
while
the
womb
and
are
fundamentally
aquatic
beings
our
earliest
developments
take
place
with
movements
similar
those
the
seafluttering
irregular
the
eye
and
experimental
undifferentiated
movement
wavemotion
allows
for
nerves
innovate
and
the
more
specific
movement
such
weight
training
the
less
neural
information
there
the
wave
motion
process
allows
for
aquaticlike
movements
within
the
body
the
neural
information
spreads
from
the
wave
motion
probabilities
for
new
synaptic
activity
generated
hookups
among
the
thousands
neural
signals
traveling
through
the
body
develop
hookups
between
new
neural
pathways
formerlyused
muscles
and
asyetunknown
pathways
for
movement
may
also
created
mindell
realized
the
healing
had
come
from
within
wasnt
process
where
the
patient
passive
and
the
other
person
fixes
them
she
says
had
willingness
participate
was
ready
the
spiritual
aspect
the
healing
for
was
allimportant
started
get
sensation
started
move
areas
body
that
were
paralyzed
showed
that
movement
and
sensation
were
the
result
much
deeper
process
went
through
long
process
letting
the
struggling
against
the
paralysis
theres
lot
that
living
life
wheelchair
forcing
and
pushing
struggling
mindell
says
she
was
able
become
more
general
her
awareness
and
not
always
focus
her
legs
and
wanting
walk
its
really
not
process
dealing
directly
with
the
issue
its
much
more
expansive
any
transformation
process
you
cant
overly
focused
paralysis
creates
more
the
samea
loop
for
myself
this
process
hasnt
been
just
healing
the
paralysis
its
more
than
just
thatspiritual
growth
development
being
able
have
full
life
have
career
artist
being
relationship
and
being
able
move
many
different
ways
through
this
process
the
increase
sensation
has
been
enormous
the
feeling
fluidity
and
movement
body
has
been
incredible
healing
although
not
quite
ambulatory
mindell
now
has
sensation
and
movement
throughout
her
lower
body
her
investigation
into
movement
has
led
profound
insights
into
the
creative
capacity
our
biological
systems
and
has
farreaching
implications
for
the
healing
community
all
paralysed
