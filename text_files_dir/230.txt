high
road
and
low
road
most
professions
taking
the
high
road
means
using
your
work
vehicle
create
something
better
the
world
and
taking
the
low
road
means
supporting
the
status

but
taking
the
low
road

not
necessarily
mean
you
are
incompetent
fact
you

well
respected
your
profession

the
criterion
for

value
the
world
lets
look
some
examples

law
many
years
ago

his
job

his
clients

work
was
not

justice
but
win
his
case
toughened
his
personality
order
continue
his
profession
and
ended
with
drug
addiction
was
sensitive
person
who
tried
deaden
the
pain
his
soulless
work
the
high
road
law
not
one
competition
but
mediation
and
this
road
opening
our
world
present
taking
the
high
road
mediation
means
that
couple
who
are
divorcing
sit
down
work
out
fair
settlement
which
acceptable
both
sides
under
the
traditional
adversarial
system
both
parties
would
try
get
much
they
could
for
themselves
healing
there
also
high
and
low
road
healing
some
parts
china
people
pay
their
doctors
keep
them
well
and
when
they
get
sick
the
doctor
looks
after
them
free
charge
this
system
emphasizes
health
the
high
road
rather
than
illness
the
low
road
north
america
billions
dollars
are
spent
each
year
heart
surgery
and
cancer
operations
which
deal
only
with
the
symptoms
and
not
the
cause
the
disease
yet
continue
sell
the
cigarettes
pollute
the
air
and
lead
the
highstress
lives
that
cause
these
diseases
the
good
news
that
the
low
road
conventional
medicine
giving
way
holistic
health
which
emphasizes
prevention

much
less

also
dumping
more

are
moves
