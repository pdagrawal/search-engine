users
wont
even
notice
marimba
also
claims
that
castanet
can
update
news
stories
quickly
that
near
real
time
requires
little
network
bandwidth
and
can
scale
millions
users
the
improved
performance
programs
and
content
due
chiefly
the
fact
that
castanet
allows

locally
hard
diskrather

down
thats
one
the
big
holes
java

the
lack
persistence
