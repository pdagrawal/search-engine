the
months
since
alyakina
was
killed
mrozek
has
watched
with
dismay
the
military
prosecutor
has
investigated
the
case
manner
that
demonstrates
both
indifference
and
incompetence
even
though
alyakina
was
struck
through
the
rear
window
her
car
the
glass
from
the
window
was
thrown
away
the
machine

that
fired
the

there
was
little

relatives
reenactment
the
shooting
took
place
early
october
the
soldier
who
fired
the
fatal
shot
sergei
fedotov
has
claimed
that
the
shooting
was
inadvertent
and
that
accidentally
activated
machine
gun
with
his
foot
while
climbing
into
armored
personnel
carrier
the
reenactment
fedotov
showed
how
climbed
down
into
the
armored
vehicle
and
touched
the
trigger
the
machine
gun
with
his
foot
mrozek
requested
that
fedotov
actually
fire
the
weapon
which
was
controlled
double
lever
specifically
prevent
accidental
firing
but
because
the
scene
the
reenactment
was
near
budyonnovsk
for
safety
reasons
the
demonstration
was
transferred
nearby
training
field
the
field
however
fedotov
was
longer
present
instead
russian
officer
took
his
place
and
succeeded
firing
two
shots
from
the
machine
gun
with
his
foot
the
demonstration
however
left
open
critical
question
the
officer
knew
advance
that
was
perform
the
complicated
maneuver
and
his
performance
did
nothing
convince
mrozek
that
the
same
thing
could
have
been
done
young
recruit
accident
mrozek
told
cpj
that
will
ask
for
new
reenactment
the
shooting
which
fedotov
himself
demonstrates
how
was
able
fire
the
machine
gun
the
widower
said
that
will
also
ask
for
psychologists
testimony
the
plausibility
the
soldiers
story
dont
think
that
someone
wanted
kill
natalya

mrozek
think
was

journalists
hit
the
ground
there
were
other
cases
shooting

some
the

this
was
the
result

this

too
there
has
been

and
there
are
widespread
fears
that
the

are
not
really
interested

and
the
transition
was
set
take
place
april
the
first
few
months
provided
opportunity
for
reexamination
many
aspects
the
stations
operation
and
one
listyevs
first
acts
after
becoming
director
was
order
the
suspension
all

beginning
april
fact
reevaluation
the

advertising
policies
was
long
overdue
the
advertising
was
being
brokered
through
mafiacontrolled
intermediary
firms
which
sold
vastly
inflated
prices
the

capable
reaching
million
people
was
extremely
attractive
for
advertisers
and
the
value

ostankino
grew
from
virtually
nothing
million
month
today
some
time
slots
the

were
booked

listyevs
decision
raised
the
prospect
massive
losses
for

for

listyev
was
murdered
one
month
before
his

and
widely
believed
that
ostankino

syndicate
ordered
his
death
but
even
with
such
obvious
leads

official
investigators
have
made

refused

the

there
have
also
been
repeated
rumors
about

many
them
printed

quoting
competent

many
investigators
however
believe
the

originate

are
intended
distract
attention
from
the
lack

they
believe
that

everything
