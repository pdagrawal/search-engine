the

one
cdts
primary
goals
the
passage
federal

that
establishes
strong

privacy
protection
for
personally

believe
that
comprehensive

that
protects
the

critical
the
public
will
not
have
trust
and
confidence
the
emerging

commend
the
efforts
chairman

and
representative
gary

for
their
leadership
towards
enacting
legislation
protect
the
privacy
health
information
presently
there
comprehensive
federal
law
that
protects
peoples
health
records
however
louis
harris
survey
found
that
most
people
this
country
mistakenly
believe
their
personal
health
information
currently
protected
law
and
most
people
mistakenly
believe
they
have
right
access
their
own
medical
information
fact
only
states
allow
patients
access
their
own
medical
records
and
only
states
have
confidentiality
laws
federal
privacy
policy
urgently
needed
address
the
increasing
demands
for
health

those
outside
the
traditional
doctorpatient
relationship
information
demands
insurance
companies
managed
health
care
companies
researchers
employers
and
law
enforcement
are
eroding
the
doctorpatient
confidentiality
that
central
health
care
cdt
believes
congress
must
act
protect
the
privacy
personally
identifiable
health
information
that
our
laws
will
finally
conform
some
extent
with
the
american
publics
perception
and
expectation
that
their
sensitive
medical
records
are
confidential
technological
innovations
that
allow
medical
records
data
and
images
transferred
easily
over
great
distances
impacts
our
country
significant
ways
the
development
national
information
infrastructure
and
information
superhighway
are
changing
the
ways
that
deal
with
each
other
traditional
barriers
distance
time
and
location
are
disappearing
information
and
transactions
become
computerized
few
relationships
the
health
care
field
will
remain
unaffected
these
changes
the
absence
any
congressional
action
the
collection
and
use
personally
identifiable
health
information
will
continue
occur
within
electronic
networked
environments
without
privacy
protections
but
while
this
information
revolution
may
hold
great
promise
for
enhancing
our
nations
health
cdt
and
others
believe
that
personal
health

both
paper
and
electronic

must
protected
strong

rules
even
useful

pose
potential
risks

fact
eightyfive
percent
said
that

most

recommending

ota
found
that
the
expanded
use

for

exacerbates
the
shortcomings
existing

the
law
must

both

appropriate

and
providing

those
who
have
been
wronged
privacy
violations
lack
such
guidelines
and
failure

could
affect

can

only
after

unauthorized

including

actress
and
published
that
she
had
been
treated
for
sexually
transmitted
disease
more
common
and
some
ways
more
troubling
than
the
wellpublicized
privacy
invasions
public
figures
are
the
consequences
suffered
ordinary
individuals
whose
privacy
has
been
compromised
the
disclosure
medical
information
for
instance
federal
auditors
demanded
the
names
patients
seeking
confidential
aids
treatment
boston
clinic
once
the
auditors
obtained
the
names
they
disclosed
the
information
other
agencies
the
harvard
community
health

boston
hmo
admitted
routinely
entering
detailed

psychotherapy
sessions
into
its
computer

which
were
then

representatives
managed

companies
even
more
common
are
the
practices
some
hmos
sending
letters
employers
detailing
the
health
problems
their
employees
surprised
individuals
have
also
discovered
that
personal
problems
they
discussed
with
employee
assistance
program
counselors
became
common
knowledge
among
their
coworkers
there
are
number
other
welldocumented
instances
breaches
health
privacy
undoubtedly
there
are
millions
similar
breaches
that
occur
either
without
the
knowledge
the
individuals
harmed
outside
the
medias
spotlight
the
need
for
comprehensive
federal
legislation
becomes
more
imperative
the
court
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
recently
ruled
that
employers
right
access
their
employees
health

outweighed
the
employees
right

while
the
court
agreed
that

found
the

was

the

the
unauthorized

dissenting
the
decision
judge
lewis
stated
hope
wrong
but
predict
that
the
courts
decision
this
case
will
make
easier
the
future
for
employers
disclose
their
employees
private
medical
information
obtained
during
audit
the
companys
health
benefit
plan
and
escape
constitutional
liability
for
harassment
other
harms
suffered
their
employees
result
that
disclosure
errors
found
medical
records
have
also
been
difficult
correct
and
control
for
instance
mary
rose
taylor
springfield
massachusetts
was
denied
health
insurance
for
over
year
because
computer
error
the
medical

bureau
mib
database
medical

used
insurance
companies
mib
reported
that
taylor
had
abnormal
urinalysis
even
though
she
had
only
taken
blood
test
taylor
was
forced
the
insurance
commissioner
her
state
correct
the
error
and
was
only
then
that
she
finally
received
health
insurance
consequences
not
protecting
personal
health
information
despite
the
public
and
private
horror
stories
about
breaches
privacy
many
americans
trust
that
the
information
they
share
with
their
doctor
kept
confidential
indeed
the
traditional
doctorpatient
relationship
intended
foster
trust
and
encourage
full
disclosure
however
once
patients
information
submitted
thirdparty
payor
any
other
entity
the
ethical
and
sometimes
legal
relationship
between
doctor
and
patient
evaporates
putting
patient
privacy
risk
fact
harris
survey
those
termed
leaders
including
hospital
ceos
health
insurance
ceos
physicians
nurses
and
state
regulators
believe
that
third
party
payors
need
governed
detailed
confidentiality
and
privacy
policies
within
our
current
health
care
system
many
individuals
engage
tactics
avoid
potential
threats
their
privacy
some
people
routinely
ask
doctors
record
false
diagnosis
because
they
fear
their
employer
may
see
their
health
records
some
people
withhold
information
from
doctors
for
fear
losing
control
over
sensitive
information
psychiatric
practices
common
for
patients
ask
doctors
not
take
notes
during
sessions
fearing
the
danger
that
such
records
the
wrong
hands
could
ruin
job
opportunity
harm
their
reputation
prevent
them
from
changing
insurance
companies
numerous
people
take
the
simple
costly
step
paying
for
medical
services
outofpocket
avoid
the
creation
insurance
records
even
though
they
are
entitled
and
have
paid
for
insurance
coverage
few
insurers
have
been
candid
enough
concede
that
their
primary
business
relationship
with
the
employer
and
not
the
employeepatient
these
insurers
may
reluctant
disclose
individuallyidentifiable
health
information
requested
employer
but
they
will
comply
pressed
most
patients
course
believe
the
fiduciary
relationship
between
themselves
and
their
doctors
and
dont
realize
that
third
party
with
direct

for

the
state
and
local
levels
employers
insurers
and
health

providers
are
forming
coalitions
develop
automated
and
linked
health

systems
containing
lifetime
health
histories
millions
americans
the
primary
goals
these
projects
are
cost
reduction
and
improved
quality

state
coalitions
are
attempting
address
the

these
newly

while
some
attempts
are
being
made
address

concerns
the
lack
comprehensive
policy
protecting
individuals
privacy
across
all
health

settings
will
leave
individual

vulnerable
the
outcome
this
piecemeal
statebystate
approach
protecting
the
privacy

security
health

information
will
lead
conflict
among
the
states
and
ultimately
set
back

relegating

some

this
means
that

that
insufficiently

both

but
the

trustees
obtain

safeguards
must
developed
for
the
use
and
disclosure

all
those
who
are

personal

must
bound
comprehensive
rules
that
ensure
the

such

warrant
requirement
for

enforcement
access
peoples
health

must
created
and
strict
civil
penalties
and
criminal

must

for

the

and
individuals
must
given
private
right
action
against
those
who
mishandle
their
personal
medical
information
without
comprehensive
protections
such
these
the
widespread
electronic
transmission
records
framework
piecemeal
and
incomplete
protections
will
produce
the
worst
both
worlds
confusion
and
red
tape
for
legitimate

users
and
debilitating
fear
and
mistrust
for
people
seeking

conclusion
cdt
believes
that
the

critical
ensuring
public
trust
and
confidence
the

health

without
assuring
the

public
that
the

will
protected
from
abuse

the

people
are
highly
suspicious
large

believe
that
their
health

are
dire
need
privacy

people
are
expected
embrace
and
participate
this
rapidly
changing
health
environment
the
price
their

must
not
the
loss

sensitive
personal

any
system
that
fails
win
the
publics
trust
will
fail
win
the
publics
support
risk
having
individuals
withdraw
from
the
full
and
honest
participation
their
own

because
they
fear
losing
their

congress
should
not
allow
people
fall
through
the
cracks
the

urge
you
