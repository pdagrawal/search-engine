with

and
complex

with
many
gray
areas
law
the
irs
audits
approximately
three
million
returns
annually
about
two
million
those
taxpayers
end
paying
more
taxes
the
irs
getting
audit
letter
from
the
irs
not
indication
that
the
irs
believes
the
taxpayer
cheater
usually
means
that
there
some
irregularity
the
return
that
the
taxpayer
has
been
selected
for
random
audit
the
taxpayer
usually
winds
paying
uncle
sam
more
money
who
audited
the
irs
has
three
primary
methods
selecting
which
returns
audit
the
first
method
random
selection
choosing
audit
some
returns
random
the
irs
promotes
better
voluntary
compliance
with
the
tax
code
because
every
return
has
chance
being
selected
for
audit
taxpayers
are
more
likely
honest
relatively
few
the
returns
selected
this
way
contain
significant
errors
but
the
irs
uses
the
results
the
random
audits
measure
compliance
with
the
law
and
update
and
improve
the
overall
tax
collection
system
the
second
method
computerized
process
whereby
the
irs
separates
out
returns
that
believes
may
contain
errors
fraudulent
the
computer
program
finetuned
each
year
based
the
experience
irs
gains
from
applying
the
tax
code
most
the
returns
selected
this
way
have
some
unusual
characteristic
that
raises
red
flag
for
auditors
for
example
the
irs
determines
that
many
taxpayers
claiming
very
large
deductions
for
entertainment
expenses
are
trying
defraud
the
government
the
computer
can
programmed
separate
out
returns
with
unusually
large
entertainment
deductions
the
irs
learns
from
its
random
audits
that
many
people
misunderstand
particular
application
the
tax
code
the
computer
can
programmed
separate
out
all
returns
relying
that
application
important
point
know
about
this
second
method
selecting
returns
that
completely
impersonal
any
return
raising
particular
red
flag
tagged
the
computer
thus
taxpayer
has
unusual
circumstance
that
gives
him
her
unusually
large
yet
legitimate
deduction
the
computer
will
select
the
return
for
audit
every
year
irs
auditors
try
avoid
repeat
examinations
for
the
same
issue
thus
the
irs
examined
taxpayers
return
for
the
same
issue
either
the
previous
two
years
and
found
favor
the
taxpayer
the
taxpayer
should
call
this
the
attention
the
irs
often
these
cases
the
audit
terminated
without
further
investigation
the
third
method
for
selecting
returns
for
audit
compares
information
provided
the
taxpayer
with
information
from
other
sources
for
example
someone
reports
less
income
his
her
return
than
reported
the
form
provided
the
taxpayers
employer
the
irs
can
seek
clarify
the
discrepancy
audit
process
the
audit
process
begins
soon
the
taxpayer
receives
letter
from
the
irs
stating
that
his
her
return
has
been
selected
for
further
examination
the
audit
may
done
entirely
mail
the
irs
has
only
few
questions
may
irs
office
the
taxpayers
home
business
the
irs
has
more
substantial
questions
the
taxpayer
can
request
that
the
audit
interview
transferred
another
irs
district
different
location
more
convenient
for
the
taxpayer
time
limits
under
normal
circumstances
the
irs
cannot
audit
tax
returns
filed
more
than
three
years
ago
for
example
the
deadline
for
the
irs
audit
tax
return
filed
the
latest
april
april
under
certain
circumstances
the
threeyear
limit
extended
the
irs
can
demand
records
far
back
six
years
audit
reveals
that
the
amount
income
the
taxpayer
failed
report
his
her
latest
return
exceeds
percent
more
the
income
reported
also
the
irs
has
time
limit
the
taxpayer
fails
file
return
determines
that
the
taxpayer
deliberately
filed
false
fraudulent
return
records
irs
auditors
almost
always
want
see
financial
records
that
relate
the
return
they
are
examining
this
raises
commonly
asked
question
how
long
does
taxpayer
need
keep
records
relating
income
tax
filings
the
answer
generally
threeandahalf
years
because
after
that
time
the
irs
typically
cannot
audit
the
taxpayer
taxpayer
should
keep
financial
documents
longer
than
threeandahalf
years
they
might
affect
any
future
returns
thus
person
should
keep
records
any
stocks
purchased
until
they
are
sold
because
only
then
can

fact
the
audit
procedure
differs
significantly
from

may
provide
fewer
procedural
safeguards
for

unlike
criminal
trial
which
defendant
presumed

until
proven

irs

the

must
prove
the

that
the

the

that
the

entirely
for

the

show
that
she
really
did
incur
the
amount
travel

claimed
she
cannot
document
the

the
irs
can
disallow
the
deduction
without
offering
any
evidence
all
person
has
the
right
ask
the
irs
cancel

she
can
show
his
her
actions

irs
thus
someone
pays

than

and
the
irs
discovers
and
penalizes
the
taxpayer

the
taxpayer
might
have
the

the

step

the
second
step
