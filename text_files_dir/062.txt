the
distributed
architecture
for
mobile
navigation
damn
behaviorbased
architecture
similar
spirit
the
subsumption
architecture
contrast
more
traditional
centralized
planners
that
build
world
model
and
plan
optimal
path
through
behaviorbased
architecture
consists
specialized
taskachieving
modules
that
operate
independently
and
are
responsible
for
only
very
narrow
portion
vehicle
control
thus
avoiding
the
need
for
sensor
fusion
distributed
architecture
has
several
advantages
over
centralized
one
including
greater
reactivity
flexibility
and
robustness
the
figure
below
shows
the
organization
the
damn
system
which
individual
behaviors
such
road
following
and
obstacle
avoidance
send
steering
speed
commands
the
command
arbitration
module
which
combines
these
inputs
into
single
steering
direction
and
speed
command
within
the
framework
damn
behaviors
provide
the
taskspecific
knowledge
for
controlling
the
vehicle
each
behavior
runs
completely
independently
and
asynchronously
providing
votes
its
appropriate
arbiter
each
its
own
rate
and
according
its
own
time
constraints
the
arbiter
periodically
combines
all
the
latest
commands
from
each
behavior
and
issues
command
the
vehicle
controller
order
allow
multiple
considerations
affect
vehicle
actions
concurrently
damn
uses
scheme
where
each
behavior
votes
for
against
each
set
possible
vehicle
actions
arbiter
then
performs
command
fusion
select
the
most
appropriate
action
for
example
vehicle
commands
such
steering
turn
radius
are
discretized
into
fixed
set
possible
alternatives
and
each
behavior
then
votes
for
against
each
command
option
with
varying
weights
reflecting
the
relative
priority
the
behaviors
the
arbiter
then
computes
weighted
sum
the
votes
has
received
from
each
behavior
and
the
command
choice
with
the
highest
value
selected
and
issued
the
vehicle
controller
damn
designed
that
various
behaviors
can
easily
added
removed
from
the
system
depending
the
current
task
hand
behaviors
that
have
been
used
include
one
that
interfaces
the

following
system
the

the
