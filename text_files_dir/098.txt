the
work
the
shaman
begins
person
becomes
aware
their
loss
preparing
welcome

ask

they
want
carry
this
preparation
time
very
important
and
often
takes
the
form
therapyeither
with
another
therapist
who
comfortable
with
shamanic
work
creates
safe
haven
for
the
returning
parts
and
lessens
the
possibility
any
part
leaving
again
after
the
retrieval
also
begins
the
work
integrating
those
parts
back
into
the
whole
sometimes
when
going
into
the
spirit
world
retrieve
soul
parts
must
negotiate
with
those
parts
which
are
wary
about
coming
back
into
what
was
abusive
situation
for
them
the
world
has
not
changed
since
they
left
they
dont
know
that
the
person
has
grown
and
now
has
the
resources
take
care
them
the
retrieval
itself
much
like
finding
power
animal
for
someone
else
this
done
not
but
own
power
animals
often
the
images
that
come
dont
make
sense
but
they
have
meaning
for
the
person
involved
after
the
retrieval
comes
the
integrative
phase
therapy
the
person
gets
know
the
returned
pieces
find
out
what
they
need
and
expect
and
what
gifts
they
bring
back
sometimes
these
parts
bring
new
sense
energy
and
vitality
and
sometimes
they
can
bring
disturbing
memories
whatever
the
case
the
individual
longer
stuck
and
can
move
his
her
life
with
new
sense
wholeness
