she
eventually
knew
every
shelf

bittersweet
irony
the

conditioning
young
lucia
put
herself
through
because
she
was
barely
out
her
teens
when
both
capacities
were
put
the
test
her
mother
strong
intense
and
deeply
religious
woman
committed
suicide
just
days
after
lucias
birthday
exactly
years
later

manon
recovered
although

continues
vulnerable
other
ailments
those
traumatic
experiences
plus
her
other

experiences
and

have
played
key
role
getsis

resulted
getsi
writing
the
awardwinning
intensive

the
creation
which
served
outlet
for
getsis
anger
and
frustration
and
also
allowed
her
proxy
for
manons
thenstill
voice
she
admits
that
being
able
write
about
the
experience
way
helped
save
her
own

books
were
young
lucias
lifeline
other
worlds
her
escape
from
smalltown
tennessee
and
endless
source
experiences
and
information
various
times
her
life
she
thought
the
information
was
her
own
once
adult
she
cut
open
infected
wound
horses
leg
squeezed
out
the
bad
blood
and
had
her

manon
lead
the
horse
stand
the
creek
each
day
for
week
until
the
water
healed
the
wound
the
horse
survived
wasnt
until
about
year
later
while
reading
the
classic
book
friend
flicka
manon
that
getsi
discovered
that
her
intuitive
knowledge
used
help
the
horse
actually
came
from
the
pages
that
book
which
she
had
read
and
reread
child
but
getsis
real
memories
experiences
observations
and
emotions
are
ingredients
that
produced
the
awardwinning
poet
author
editor
and
professor
she
today
illinois
state
university
although
her
careers
educator
and
writer
have
been
distinguished
for

the

have
been
particularly
frequent
recent

she
was
the

and
one
taught
this
filly

intense
personal
experiences
have
not
only
been
the
subjects
her
writing
but
the
insight
getsi
gained
during
those
experiences
and
throughout
her
life
continue
invigorate
her
poetic
juices
but
experiences
and
emotions
and
observation
dont
make
the
poetry
write
itself
getsi
spends
countless
hours
each
work
and
particularly
enjoys
the
opportunity
focus
only
poetry
while
residencies
such
last
summers
residency
the
ragsdale
foundation
lake
forest
when
writers
colony
grant
all
write
she
says
can
obsess
about
one
poem
for
weeks
want
often
ill
write
one
humongous
poem
and
then
the
filtering
starts
there
are
huge
baths
imagery
thought
context
emotions
that
wash
over
the
original
images
thoughts
and
ideas
started
with
poetry
the
kind
art
that
needs
long
spaces
time
think
and
create
and
just
allow
the
fluid
movement
images
wash
over
the
whole
paradigmatic
axis
memory
the
whole
memory
self
thats
what
grants
such
from
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts
permit
artists
but
now
the
stupid
totalitarian
people
who
are
scared
ideas
and
who
want
the
world
their
way
have
had
their
way
with
the
nea
and
its
basically
gone
she
says
write
book
poetry
takes
usually
five
years
but
intensive
care
was
exception
took
from
about
when
first
started
writing
those
poems
was
very
cathartic
the
poem
nursing
was
written
when
was
such
rage
was
angry
the
kind
anger
where
you
think
you
are
going
melt
was
angry
the
entire
medical
profession
angry
nurses
who
couldnt
spell
remember
cover
manons
stomach
with
the
lead
shield
during
the
chest
rays
during
manons
first
months
hospitalization
none
her
bodys
systems
were
working
including
her
ability
speak
she
communicated
spelling
words
not
vocally
but
having
her
mother
nurse
recite
the
alphabet
out
loud
while
she
indicated
blinking
letter
letter
the
words
she
wanted
communicate
nurse
who
either
could
not
spell
who
did
not
want
make
the
effort
communicate
manonstyle
moved
manons
headset
which
the
paralyzed
teenager
used
call
for
the
nurse
out
reach
her
headthe
only
body
part
she
could
move
that
time
result
manon
could
not
alert
the
doctors
that
her
feeding
tube
was
twisted
and
she
was
great
pain
and
long
overdue
for
pain
shot
her
mother
discovered
the
problem
the
next
morning
she
addressed
the
nurses
nursing
see
page
there
were
wonderful
nurses
too
course
she
recalls
but
the
poem
was
cathartic
dealing
with
those
bad
ones
some
the
other
poems
the
book
were
ways
funneling
unresolved
things
from
life
through
that
experience
that
experience
cast
new
light
those
unresolved
things
the
kind
light
that
makes
meaning
life
that
kind
making
meaning
what
makes
human
manon
still
weeps
her
mothers
public
readings
from
intensive
care
and
this
day
there
still
one
poem
that
getsi
cannot
read
aloud
without
choking
little
the
book
for
her
experience
her
illness
she
says
mirror
she
can
look
back
into
because
blessedly
she
did
not
see
herself
the
mirror
during
that
time
the
time
she
looked
though
she
would
not
survive
and
did
not
let
her
see
that
although
she
continues
bring
poetry
classrooms
illinois
and
elsewhere
getsi
cant
hide
her
disappointment
the
state
reading
especially
reading
poetry
these
days
poetry
just
isnt
there
the
schools
she
says
isnt
public
schools
isnt
the
libraries
isnt
even
much
the
bookstores
except
for
specialized
bookstores
anything
that
requires
lonely
concentration
not
the
schools
anymore
its
not
financial
issue
its
just
unnatural
our
contemporary
culture
silent
but
poetry
grows
out
that
silence
result
poetry
now
has
been
marginalized
and
hidden
reading
during
childhood
particularly
reading
poetry
can
introduce
children
new
worlds
information
and
insight
and
experience
that
can
ultimately
inspire
them
explore
their
own
ideas
and
feelings
children
getsi
firmly
believes
need
poetry
and
art
and
music
and
drama
and
all
the
arts
their
lives
early
possible
order
have
the
greatest
benefit
throughout
theirlives
but
the
great
power
poetry
nowhere
found
too
many
american
schools
ninety
percent
the
teachers
elementary
and
high
schools
dont
know
where
find
poetry
ive
been
hundreds
school
libraries
where
they
dont
have
books
the
library
only
audiovisual
equipment
computers
most
school
libraries
dont
have
poetry
especially
elementary
school
libraries
its
because
students
arent
expected
and
read
and
they
they
dont
read
poetry
because
they
havent
been
exposed
ive
been
some
the
best
schools
our
state
poetry
workshop
and
have
had
students
who
have
never
read
poem
they
might
get
hallmark
card
with
what
called
poetry
and
thats
what
they
think
poetry
what
you
getsi

you
how

times
ive
received
calls
from

poetry
they
dont
have

before
teaching
all
they
have
enjoy

let
students
enjoy
just
put
the
poetry
out
there
the
program
free
the
schools
but
they
have
under
conditions
three
weeks

the
english

she
says

spoon
river

review
poet
and
try
feature
two
poets
year
with
illinois
connection
have
endless
supply
throughout
the
state
the
only
thing
want
come
out
that
students
have
fantastically
wonderful
integrating
experience
with
poetry
they
accomplish
something
learn
something
new
get
excited
about
assimilate
accommodate
and
are
changed
and
they
are
different
people
when
assistant
walk
out
their
room
want
the
students
have
experience
that
imprints
deeply
that
they
will
associate
the
experience
with
language
with
poetic
language
and
with
poetic
form
forever
they
know
something
called
poetry
and
they
can
access
that
world
any
time
they
want
easily
teach
them
the
access
points
the
literary
bookstores
the
small
presses
now
the
internet
how
get
the
books
and
what
books
look
for
lest
anyone
get
the
impression
that
the
absence
poetry
the
schools
tempts
her
quit
bringing
poetry
the
younger
set
getsi
brims
with
hope
and
excitement
when
she
tells
about
the
students
the
class
she
met
granville
illinois
the
very
atrisk
teenagers
attending
special
los
angeles
school
that
serves
their
last
chance
high
school
diploma
her
discussions
about
poetry
with
all
those
groups
getsi
sometimes
uses
prints
paintings
horses
german
artist
franz
marc
basis
for
imagery
use
franz
marcs
works
because
they
always
have
weird
stuff
them
that
cant
explained
she
says
ask
the
students
walk
into
the
picture
and
describe
what
happening
ask
them
describe
shapes
and
step
and
out
the
painting
and
walk
around
the
horses
the
picture
the
assignment
write
communal
poem
which
everyone
contributes
and
which
ends
many
pages
long
before
gets
whittled
down
see
page
and
that
complete
experience
getsi
says
they
brought
their
whole
world
into
and
put
another
world
into
that
whole
world
and
have
taken
that
enriched
world
and
galloped
wherever
they
think
they
are
going
back
but
theyll
never
get
back
because
these
are
changed
little
people
theyll
never
look
art
the
same
way
horse
the
same
way
that
the
secret
power
art
its
about
imagination
and
the
ability
imagine
she
says
television
and
movies
steal
our
ability
imagine
and
thats
killer
for
poetry
without
the
ability
imagine
you
cant
really
read
but
you
particularly
cant
read
poetry
unless
you
can
picture
your
mind
everything
that
passes
front
you
poem
you
get
nothing
out
cant
teach
students
write
until
teach
them
how
think
metaphorically
imagebased
way
the
kids
were
kids
who
had
seen
everything
pregnancy
drugs
guns
death
they
really
wanted
this
school
although
its
very
hard
and
they
dont
stick
with
they
are
out
laid
out
the
paintings
and
started
talking
about
them
they
are
very
smart
kids
with
wonderful
language
skills
the
poetry
they
wrote
spoke
volumes
all
their
hope

admits
but
ive

differently
redistributing

writing
helps
rechannel

because
requires
intense
paying

and
requires
selfhonesty
that
could

but
really

you
are
very
aware
when
you
are
writing
when
you
are
