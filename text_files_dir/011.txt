such
laserjet

particularly
suitable
for

causes

and
the
water
can
easily
recycled
drained

the
requirements
the
pelt

were
requested
make
two
cuts
see

the

was
required
that
the

maintained
throughout
the
radius
the
second
cut
was
done
degree
angle
the
upper
surface
this
cut
was
made
the
already
existing

the
degree
cut
this
would
mean
that
the
overall

the

should
measured
its

there
were
specified

again
there
was

that
had

this

there
was
also
specification
that
this

had
millimetres
from
the

had
maintained
this

consists
fanuc
robot
using
controller
and
the
robot
language
four
parts
are
cut
from
one
pelt
before
the
cut
parts
are
unloaded
and
the
next

placed
the

the
first
attempt
manual
programming
the
first
attempt
solve
the
problem
involved
teaching
the
robot
hand
using
the
fanuc
teachpendant
this
required
great
deal
time
and
patience
teach
the
hundreds
points
required
for
each
the
four
cuts
although
the
programmer
could
fine
tune
points
taught
eye
entering
numbers
calculated
using
the
mathematics
the
part
was
still
extremely
difficult
ensure
that
the
angle
the
cuts
was
consistent
further
problem
was
that
the
cuts
were
not
repeatable
over
the
four
parts
because
the
distortion
the
robot
envelope
due
the
geometric
structure
the
robot
the
points
used
cut
part
one
area
the
pelt
when
transferred
another
area
the
pelt
gave
less
consistent
cuts
waterjet
cutting
very
demanding
application
because
any
deviation
that
the
robot
makes
its
path
any
change
velocity
any
defect
the
robot
will
show
the
final
part
after
about
hours
programming
the
parts
being
cut
were
still
not
the
quality
required
the
solutionsimulationcalibration
and
offline
programming
using
workspacerobotrak
rpt
chose
use
robot
simulation
software
package
named
workspace
perform
the
simulation
calibration
and
offline
programming
the
workcell
the
key
factors
this
decision
were
follows
workspace
integrated
with
the
robotrak
robot
and
tool
calibration
system
this
close
integration
means
that
robot
and
tool
calibration
for
both
the
tool
offset
and
orientation
quick
and
effective
workspace
allow
users
work
the
robots
native

this
case
this
provides
users
with
the
entire
power
the
language
without
the
need
for
postprocessing
any
kind
offline
programming
therefore
onestep
process
the

system
quick
and
easy
use
this
enabled
the
workcell
designed
workspace
can
run
any
ibmcompatible
the
cost
the
hardware
required
for
the
simulation
was
therefore
kept
minimum
and
existing
pcs
present
used
for
other
purposes
might
used
workspace

also

this
enables
the
engineers

easy

use
even

since
the
three

can
placed

closed

linked
arcs

the
geometry
points
required
along
each
polyline
representing
the
meeting
point
the
waterjet
and
the
part
were
taught
within
workspace
along
the
polyline
these
geometry
points
are
like
robot
teachpoints
except
that
they
are
stored
with
the
model
and
may
therefore
easily
moved
the

defined
the
programmer
this
technique
over
defining
the
path
using
more
points
than
might
seem
necessary
ensures
that
the
robot
follows
the
path
more
precisely
the
part
was
then
copied
four
times
and
placed
within
the
workcell
this
also
copies
and
moves
the
geometry
points
four
times
that
they
not
need
redefined
for
each
part
the
fanuc
robot
model
was
loaded
from
the
robot
library
and
placed
within
the
workcell
the
placing
the
robot
was
such
that
any
the
geometry
points
were
unachievable
then
the
geometry
points
were
displayed

the
robot
could
then
repositioned

then
moved

attached

this

was
used
teach
three
teachpoints
which
just
touched
each
the
four
pelts
taking
these
teachpoints
back
into
workspace
and
comparing
them
with
the
geometry

taught
the

was
possible
