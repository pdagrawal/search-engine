april
met
student
report
seven
this
folks
endeavor
lands
tomorrow
and
were
going
home
either
tomorrow
wednesday
what
long
strange
trip
its
been
yknow
weve
been
writing
these
things
for
week
and
half
now
and
wonder
anyone
has
been
reading
them
going
post
our
email
addresses
the
end
this
that
you
get
the
urge
say
ask
further
questions
just
tell
that
you
read
these
things
you
can
yesterday
was
aarons
airground
link
with
endeavor
and
well
let
him
speak
later
first
yesterdays
report
talked
lot
about
the
outside
jsc
which
interesting
but
kind
superfluous
the
really
incredible
stuff
whats
the
buildings
you
already
know
about
the
clean
rooms
mission
control
and
eol
the
only
other
place
that
weve
got
personal
experience
with
building
eight
half
building
eight
the
onsite
medical
facility
the
other
half
the
half
weve
used
has
video
and
photo
labs
and
computer
set
print
photos
from
laser
disk
ive
got
diverge
from
divergence
for
bit
tell
you
about
the
photos
average
shuttle
mission
comes
home
with
three
five
thousand
frames
photographic
film
from
cameras
high
enough
quality
that
they
can
take
detailed
earth
pictures
from
orbit
these
pictures
are
all
developed
numbered
cataloged
according
latitude
longitude
main
visible
features
etc
this
information
stored
database
jsc
called
sseopjscnasagov
which
public
access
nasa
also
publishes
laser
disks
which
contain
several
tens
thousands
shuttle
photos
apiece
which
makes
slightly
easier
find
lets
say
the
photos
from
sts
roll
frame
thats
the
only
other
building
that
know
from
personal
experience
however
weve
been
told
about
lot
incredible
stuff
which
hopefully
well
get
see
once
the
shuttle
has
landed
theres
building
which
set
run
simulations
mission
control
has
the
capabilities
feed
data
into
mission
control
that
exactly
replicates
shuttle
mission
and
they
can
through
any
number
anomalies
see
how
well
the
ground
crew
prepared
for
them
unless
you
have
participated
simulation
youre
not
allowed
through
mission
control
unescorted
during
mission
astronaut
training
goes
here
and
assume
theyve
also
got
the
standard
battery
equipment
that
youve
seen
the
right
stuff
however
told
that
they
have
full
array
equipment
the
american
government
just
about
the
biggest
user
the
world
for
just
such
applications
like
this
the
equipment
they
use
today
probably
saves
them
thousands
dollars
per
astronaut
materials
used
for
training
slight
divergence
and
then
well
aaron
anyone
out
there
netland
interested
working
shuttle
mission
this
for
you
sts
the
second
srl
mission
flying
august
then
would
like
have
network
people
across
the
country
even
across
the
world
possible
online
jsc
during
the
mission
any
these
people
knew
anything
interesting
going
their
area
flooding
fires
anything
major
that
could
seen
from
space
and
might
make
difference
the
radar
theyd
write
with
report
what
they
knew
where
they
were
any
and
all
information
that
they
thought
pertinent
our
information
here
limited
what
gets
put
the
net
the
newspapers
its
something
like
volcano
eruption
earthquake
were
not
likely
get
any
information
until
its
over
and
while
aftermath
probably
interesting
doesnt
give
any
more
information
about
the
way
the
world
works
youre
interested
helping
out
shuttle
mission
write
either
aaron
jon
and
now
wrap
the
series
heres
aaron
with
what
happened
last
night
stop
the
presses
before
aaron
says
word
weve
forgotten
thank
the
six
most
important
people
the
entire
mission
thank
you
shuttle
commander
sidney
gutierrez
thank
you
mission
specialist
michael
clifford
thank
you
pilot
kevin
chilton
thank
you
mission
specialist
thomas
jones
thank
you
payload
commander
linda
godwin
thank
you
mission
specialist
jay
apt
these
six
are
the
astronauts
who
served
aboard
the
endeavour
weve
been
leaving
out
the
endeavour
all
week
oops
for
sts
the
space
radar
laboratory
was
their
incredible
dedication
and
hard
work
that
enabled
this
mission
spectacularly
smoothly
and
almost
forgot
thank
them
shame
now
back
our
regularly
scheduled
report
here
start
out
was
talking
linda
godwin
the
payload
commander
was
kind
neat
because
also
talked
her
once
before
last
summer
jpl
particular
amenities
were
exchanged
the
format
our
conversations
with
the
crew
are
long
comment
then
several
smaller
comments
with
space
for
response
told
her
about
how
worked
two
years
ago
the
field
the
upper
peninsula
michigan
one
the
sites
that
they
have
imaged
told
her
about
what
incredible
experience
was
getting
away
from
science
class
something
like
that
like
working
jsc
the
feeling
absolutely
different
learning
the
job
like
this
incredible
what
doing
matters
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
the
world
something
goes
wrong
high
school
physics
class
nobody
cares
here
when
someone
asks
you
find
something
out
and
they
need
hour
for
the
shuttle
flyby
you
dont
get
chance
over
and
you
not
fail
you
did
screw
dont
really
think
that
anyone
would
care
they
plan
for
that
and
happens
but
thats
not
what
happens
you
you
the
best
job
possible
and
involves
learning
some
radar
science
meteorology
computer
science
well
thems
the
breaks
love
anyway
once
got
done
with
that
noted
that
had
been
wondering
how
different
the
training
had
been
for
this
mission
opposed
her
others
and
she
was
nice
enough
oblige
telling
pretty
much
the
same
thing
happened
when
wondered
what
differences
she
noticed
the
state
the
world
between
yesterday
and
week
before
that
all
all
was
fun
and
informative
and
got
real
kick
out
talking
the
shuttle
folks
heres
where
get
off
its
been
fun
all
learned
little
and
nobody
got
hurt
hope
that
youve
enjoyed
reading
these
things
much
weve
enjoyed
writing
them
encourage
correspondence
thats
how
you
learn
and
learnings
how
you
grow
signing
