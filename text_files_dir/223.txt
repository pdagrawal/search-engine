introduction
and

guiding
principles
from
the
internet
experience
commend
the
commission
for
holding
this
forum
explore
means
providing
affordable
widely
available
access
the
nii
general
and
the
internet
particular
the
growth
the
internet
gives
the
federal
communications
commission
unique
opportunity
advance
one
its
core
communications
policy
goals
providing
americans
with
ready
access
diversity
information
sources
and
communication
opportunities
these
brief
remarks
cdt
hopes
offer
observations
critical
factors
which
have
lead
the
dramatic
growth
the
internet
unique
characteristics
which
make
the
internet
rich
forum
for
democratic
discourse
and
lessons
for
the
future
that
can
take
from
these
developments
the
internet
has
shown
that
both
choice
architecture
and
cost
service
are
essential
providing
widespread
access
diversity
information
the
internet
manifests
five
critical
attributes
its
basic
architecture
that
give
such
potential
enhance
democratic
discourse
decentralized
gatekeeperfree
access
bidirectional
interactive
capability
multiple
competitive
access
points
open
standards
affordable
service
considering
policies
promote
broader
access
advanced
communications
infrastructure
hope
that
the
commission
will
take
these
characteristics
baseline
policy
goals
the
democratic
potential
the
internet
will
only
realized
with
broad
access
the
net
for
both
individuals
and
community
organizations
the
commission
can
help
bring
that
potential
the
internet
the
broad
crosssection
the
population
encouraging
the
development
new
access
options
that
promote
these
essential
attributes
the
internet
architecture
open
decentralized
architecture
the
strength
the
internet
derives
from
both
affordable
access
and
uniquely
open
architecture
traditional
communications
media
such
radio
and
television
have
been
affordable
and
readily
available
around
the
country
but
have
failed
enable
full
democratic
because
architectural
limitations
for
example
online
discussions
political
issues
enable
users
exchange
views
and
even
pose
questions
political
figures
way
that
broadcast
television
can
never
support
the
internets
architecture
allows
for
diversity
views
and
exchange
information
which
are
simply
impossible
any
other
communications
medium
decentralized
gatekeeperfree
infrastructure
the
internet
supports
such
great
diversity
opinion
ideas
and
information
because
decentralized
network
user
can
create
new
web
site
participate
usenet
newsgroup
without
obtaining
permission
advance
from
any
central
authority
for
example
create
web
page
that
will
publicly
accessible
millions
internet
users
around
the
world
one
need
only
find
internetconnected
computer
and
often
pay
that
operator
that
computer
for
web
site
hosting
service
the
decentralized
architecture
the
internet
has
guaranteed
that
there
will
numerous
web
site
hosts
from
which
chose
unlike
traditional
broadcast
media
the
internet
has
central
control
point
anyone
with
content
publish
ideas
exchange
can
from
any
point
the
network
equally
important
the
resources
needed
establish
new
web
page
post
new
idea
are
essentially
unlimited
adding
new
web
page
new
newsgroup
posting
does
not
require
that
another
site
page
eliminated
from
the
net
fact
the
marginal
cost
the
last
web
page
added
the
net
equal
less
than
the
cost
the
first
page
this
environment
characterized
abundance
communications
opportunities
this
abundance
stands
sharp
contrast
the
scarcity
channels
and
spectrum
which
has
been
such
prominent
feature
for
example
the
broadcast
and
cable
television
media
broadcasting
program
todays
television
systems
requires
that
one
compete
for
and
usually
pay
high
price
for
channel
slot
under
the
control
the
broadcaster
cable
operator
the
high
demand
for
channels
traditional
media
has
raised
their
cost
far
beyond
the
means
most
community
organizations
and
all
but
the
wealthiest
individuals
new
infrastructure
access
options
develop
critical
that
they
continue
support
access
this
decentralized
manner
bidirectional
interactive
capability
all
internet
users
are
able
both
speakers
and
listeners
publishers
and
readers
content
providers
and
content
consumers
the
bidirectional
interactive
nature
the
net
another
key
attribute
that
makes
such
unique
and
effective
forum
for
democratic
discourse
indeed
only
the
proverbial
town
square
there
greater
degree
interactive
backandforth
communications
than
what
possible
online
advanced
telecommunications
access
services
develop
will
essential
assure
continued
upstream
and
downstream
interactive
communications
paths
multiple
competitive
access
points
from
the
beginning
the
internet
was
designed
support
multiple
access
points
initially
this
was

for
disasterproof
network
today
all
reap
the
benefit
this
decentralized
architecture
that
allows
more
service
providers
connect
the
net
every
day
and
make
new
services
available
most
areas
the
country
internet
access
available
from
variety
sources
including
small

the
growth
technical

and
increasingly
wide

the
internet
has
been
spurred
recent
years
the
vibrant
competitive
market
for
internet
access
services
citizens
and
organizations
that
rely
the
internet
have
been
the
beneficiaries
this
competitive
environment
service
providers
compete
offer
better
prices
more
reliable
basic

and
innovative
new

such
web

with
the
latest

features
the
benefits
open

beyond
mere
price
competition
open
interconnection
features
the
internet
assure
that
services
will
develop
meet
the
varying
needs
the
diverse
internet
user
community
from
large
corporations
small

individuals
and
small
community
organizations
great
diversity
users
made
possible
because

are
able
coexist
the

this

creates
the
potential
for

environment
allows
the

evolve

needs
from
year

the
face
the
internet
changes
today
many
people
think
and
experience
the
internet
primarily
the
world
wide
web
yet
two
three
years
ago
the
web
was
little
more
than
experimental
service
being
developed
physics
laboratory
switzerland
this
years
world
wide
web
vastly
different
and
more
powerful
flexible
and
easy
use
than
was
last
year
more
technical
level
internet
routing
and
addressing
protocols
are
evolving
order
meeting
increasing
usage
levels
around
the
world
these
and
other
technical
advances
have
been
possible
because
the
open
public
standards
which
the
internet
built
this
open
environment
new
technologies
can
developed
and
deployed
various
members
the
internet
community
new
standards
which
gain
popularity
are
adopted
the
net
whole
while
others
are
not
this
development
process
however
can
proceed
relatively
easily
because
the
basic
internet
standards
are
public
and
available
building
blocks
for
new
developments
affordable
access
the
internets
architecture
what
makes
unique
but
would
use
access
were
too
expensive
for
users
there
are
good
reasons
believe
that
information
the
internet
will
inherently
more
affordable
than
other
media
however
multimedia
and
other
highbandwidth
applications
become
more
popular
the
ability
the
voicecall
oriented
telecommunications
infrastructure
maintain
affordable
access
the
net
will
called
into
question
three
separate
cost
elements
ought
distinguished
this
discussion
the
cost
personal
computer
other
access
hardware
the
cost
internet
online
services
and
the
cost
the
underlying
telecommunications
service
which
connects
the
user
the
internet
online
service
hardware
costs
remain
substantial
but
new
developments
the
market
such
webtv
network
computers
and
consumeroriented
pcs
suggest
that
this
barrier
may
easing
internet
access
service
costs
continue
decrease
the
face
competitive
market
finally
although
the
low
cost
basic
telephone
service
especially
flat
rate
local
calling
has
been
viewed
significant
boon
the
net
most
internet
users
around
the
country
have
viable
option
other
than
slow
analog
phone
lines
internet
users
need
more
choices
particularly
architectural
choices
the
market
for
the
basic
telecommunications
components
internet
access
order
maintain
affordable
higherbandwidth
methods
access
the
network
the
question
affordable
access
raised
most
directly
the
commissions
ongoing
proceedings
internet
access
fees
cdt
will
filing
comments
those
proceedings
and
will
seek
address
these
issues
more
fully
that
time
iii
conclusion
toward
more
affordable
higher
capacity
digital
decentralized
network
infrastructure
again
commend
the
commission
for
beginning
this
inquiry
into
the
question
how
promote
the
availability
higher
bandwidth
services
the
challenge
facing
the
commission
and
other
policy
makers
going
forward
enable
users
have
access
increasingly
high
capacity
affordable
digital
access
options
manner
that
consistent
with
the
fundamental
architectural
characteristics
that
have
made
the
internet
such
important
new
medium
high
bandwidth
service
needed
but
only
useful
where
maintains
the
open
decentralized
competitive
environment
that
has
helped
the
internet
grow
serve
democratic
values
achieving
all
these
goals
the
context
other
changes
occurring
throughout
the
telecommunications
market
will
indeed
challenge
cdt
does
not
come
this
forum
with
fixed
policy
prescription
but
rather
hope
that
the
commissions
activities
can
guided
the
stunning
success
already
manifest
the
development
the
internet
when
sitting
consider
the
application
first
amendment
principles
the

federal
court
philadelphia
found
that
the
internet
the
most
participatory
form
mass
speech
yet
developed
the
extraordinary
success
the
internet
thus
far
and
the
great
potential
that
holds
out
should
serve
model
for
the
