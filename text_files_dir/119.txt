ten

into

uncertainty
researching
the
nonconventional
free
energy
movement
was
living
vernon
and
heard
about
inventor

who
invented
extraordinary
magnetic
dynamo
named
his
company

because
believed
that
powerful

somehow
suck

recognized
the
ancientsfrom

around
using

permanent

claimed
the

when
fully
developed
would
put
out
more
electricity
than

explanations
