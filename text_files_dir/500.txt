with

from

one
territory
over

aol
resolved
the
complaints
statewashingtonwhen
agreed
allow
members
pick
their
pricing
plan
from
opening
splash
screen
that
shows
when
users
log
but
the
agreement
apparently
did
not
appease
the
other
attorneys
general
who
are
continuing
negotiate
with
aol
nor
did
apparently
resolve
those
dilorenzo
aols
new
pricing
plan
slated
take
effect
after

when
the
members
billing
cycle
begins
will
automatically
replace

five
hours
service
for

with
flatrate
plan
that
provides
unlimited
service
for
per
month
under
the
current
plan
users
pay
for
each
additional
hour
pricing
scheme
that
has
cost
many
users
lot
more
than
many
members
have
applauded
aols
move
provide
unlimited
access
for
but
the
way
aol
has
implemented
the
new
prices
has
come
under
fire
from
legal
experts
and
users
alike
critics
say
that
aol
should
have
asked
users
choose
whether
they
wanted
the
new
plan
rather
than
being
switched
automatically
aol
will
allow
users
retain
their
current
pricing

but
everybody
else
will
start

because
the

aol
users
now
are
presented
with
choice

anyone
who
