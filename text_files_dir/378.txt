thus
only

the

though

not

forever
parties
are

keep
things
moving
along
exercising
the

within
reasonable
length
time
after
the

rendered
like
statute

every

has
rule
dictating

during

the

days
the

its

party
the
party
who
wishes

loses
that
right
forever
sometimes
there
question
when
the
final
judgment
the
trial
court
was
entered
employment
discrimination
case
which
plaintiff
sought
back
pay
and
other
damages
court
issued
order
setting
forth
its
findings
fact
and
conclusions
law
and
stating
that
judgment
was
for
the
plaintiff
and
against
the
defendant
some
months
later
the
court
issued
another
order
awarding
back
pay
and
retroactive
promotion
the
plaintiff
yet
another
order
was
entered
the
next
month
which
the
court
granted
the
plaintiff
attorneys
fees
and
litigation
expenses
question
arose
about
when
the
clock
started
ticking
for
the
defendant
file
notice
appeal
which
order
was
the
final
order
for
purposes
appeal
the
appeals
court
held
that
the
last
order
granting
fees
and
expenses
was
the
final
judgment
the
case
because
dispensed
with
the
last
the
issues
raised
the
plaintiffs
complaint
the
scope
review
what
appeals
court
has
authority
decide
limited
the
appellant
must
outline
the
specific
question
wants
answered
the
appeals
court
the
question
may
broad
did
the
trial
court
err
deciding
favor
the
plaintiff
may
very
specific
usually
the
appellant
asks
that
several
critical
questions
answered
historically
rather
than
filing
appeal
party
was
said
file
writ
error
the
writ
error
was
request
higher
court
overturn
the
lower
courts
final
decision
based
critical
error
reasoning
simply
because
the
decision
was
wrong
plaintiff
who
loses
age
discrimination
case
for
instance
may
file
appeal
challenging
the
bases
upon
which
the
trial
judge
made
his
her
decision
this
appeal
might
structured
did
the
trial
judge
err
when
she
ruled
that
the
age
discrimination
employment
act
did
not
apply
did
the
trial
judge
err
when
she
ruled
that
the
plaintiff
was
required
show
that
was
replaced
worker
outside
the
protected
age
group
did
the
trial
judge
err
when
she
ruled
that
the
plaintiff
failed
establish
prima
facie
case
because
appeals
are
structured
this
way
sometimes
said
that
the
actions
the
trial
judge
are
trial
not
the
actions
the
parties
the
original
litigation
fact
the
parties
not

the
only
opportunity
submit

the
appeals
court
only
considers
whether
the
trial
was
conducted
properly
and
whether
the
outcome
was
reached
proper
application
the
law
the
facts
noted
above
the
only
question
for
appeals
court
may
very
specific
such
whether
particular
document
should
have
been
submitted
but
only
issues
that
were

this

plaintiff
for

may
not
ask
the
appellate
court
overturn
the

the

judge
based
new

that
the

judge
never
saw
the

was
the
only
opportunity
present
the

the
other
hand
the
plaintiff
may
argue

that
the

should
have
allowed
his

testify
long
the
plaintiff
made
that
argument
his
original
case
may
give
the
appellate
court
indication
what
the

would
have
said
the
court
can
weigh
whether
the
exclusion
the
testimony
was
harmful

case
enough
make

should
have
been

the
testimony
would
have
been
similar
that
witness
who
did
take
the
stand
and
whose
testimony
did
not
carry
much
weight
the
jury
probably
would
not
have
found
the

very
compelling

the
