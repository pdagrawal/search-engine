the

bars
the

claim
however

legal
concept
that
essentially
asks
whether
the

proximate
cause
easiest
prove
lawyer
misses

cases
the

one
problem
determining

that
the
average

judge
may

the
standard

needs
affidavit
from
medical
expert
when

there
are
many
complex
questions
deciding
what
testimony
allow
every
case
the
judge
must
decide
whether
doctors
actions
are
judged
against
all
other
doctors
only
against
doctors
specializing

some
judges

questions

care
another
reasonably

the
toughest
point
prove
medical

lawsuit
because

the

fell
short

level
injury
injury
usually
not
difficult
prove
medical
malpractice
actions
patient
who
dies
suffers
permanent
disability
chronic
pain
obviously
has
been
injured
often
the
doctor
who
has
most
trouble
disproving
this
element
because
can
difficult
prove
that
patient
who
claims
injured
not
many
legitimate
injuries
such
whiplash
have
few
quantifiable
manifestations
even
though
they
cause
their
sufferers
feel
pain
injury
need
not
permanent
compensable
proximate
cause
finally
proximate
causation
can
difficult
for
patient
prove
because
bad
result
does
not
necessarily
equal
malpractice
even
with
excellent
treatment
patient
might
not
recover
totally
from
the
condition
for
which
she
seeks
treatment
doctor
accused
malpractice
might
able
show
that
even
had
different
treatment
been
followed
the
patient
would
have
suffered
identical
injuries
thirdparty
lawsuits
third
persons
can
sometimes
bring
medical
malpractice
lawsuits
against
doctors

person
who
gets
infectious
disease
from
friend
might
sue
the
friends
doctor
for
inadequately
treating
the
disease
person
injured
automobile
accident
might
bring
medical
malpractice
lawsuit
against
the
drivers
doctor

doctor

while
under

forms
required
