the

pcmdis
principal

develop

climate
modeling
and
analysis
the
need
for
standards
both
modeling
and
analysis
has
become
increasingly
apparent
more
complex
models
are
developed
while
the
disagreement
among
models
and
between
models
and
observations
remains
significant
and
poorly
understood
the
nature
and
causes
these
disagreements
must
accounted
for
systematic
fashion
before
models
can
confidently
used
for
climate
sensitivity
and
predictability
