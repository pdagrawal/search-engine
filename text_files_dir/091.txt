daniel
cheng
sees
the
institute
serving
many
purposes
research
can
determine
the
validity
some
the
alternative
methods
and
testing
can
help
other
ways
well
this
can
more
convincing
and
help
protect
the
consumers
rights
cheng
says
some
methods
prove
successful
during
testing
may
eventually
lead
cheaper
health
care
for
everyone
the
health
the
general

improves

there
may
have

openminded
now

their
best
help
with
