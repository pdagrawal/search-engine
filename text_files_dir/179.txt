europe
the

market
has
experienced
cyclic
growth
which
reached
the
peak
its
high
development
phase
this
trend
was
even
more
accentuated
the
italian
market
after
important
laws
issued
the
italian
parliament
which
contributed
further
boost
its
momentum
brief
the
inductive

understandable
how
these
laws
have
positively
influenced
the
growth
the
italian
domestic
pleasure

market
which
chalked
amazing
increase
from
since
yearend
however
the
industry
has
been
experiencing
slightly
weaker
demand
for
pleasure

several
factors
have
contributed
this
end
including
the
decline
the
overall
economy
with
slower
growth
personal
income
and
the
reluctance
pleasure

consumers

skyrocketing
