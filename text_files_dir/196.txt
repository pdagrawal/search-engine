april
low
earthorbiting
leo
receiver
was
successfully
launched
aboard
the
microlab
satellite
this
receiver
orbiting
altitude
about
receives
radio
signals
from
the
constellation
global
positioning
system
gps
satellites
these
radio
signals
are
refracted
bent
the
earths
atmosphere
and
measuring
the
doppler
shifted
frequency
the
received
radio
signals
these
measurements
are
converted
into
vertical
pressure
and
temperature
profiles
the
earths
atmosphere
early
results
indicate
that
accuracies
about
are
being
obtained
between

about
this
new
remote
sensing
technique
promises
open
new
ways
monitor
climate
and
climate
change
and
also
provide
substantially
improved
initial
global
data
for
weather
