this
project
the

center
addresses
the
task
building
elevation
maps
the
seafloor
for
autonomous
underwater
vehicle
auv
using
sonar
data
sonar
the
preferred
sensing
modality
for
auvs
because
less

the

than
common
terrestrial

sensors
like
cameras
and
laser
range
finders
sonar
systems
designed
directly
generate
maps
their
environment
are
generally
complex
have
low
resolution
while
systems
that
generate
backscatter
images
their
environment
are
less
complicated
and
more
common
hence
techniques
that
generate
elevation
maps
from
sonar
backscatter
images
are
necessary
for
terrain
modeling
and
navigation
underwater
use
backscatter

collected
sidescan

system

this
type
sonar
returns
the
backscatter
from
the
observed

function

the

the

then
consecutive

each
other
create
backscatter
image
the
seafloor
have
developed
two
techniques
for
the
generation
elevation
maps
the
seafloor
from
sidescan
sonar
backscatter
images
these
techniques
employ
scattering
model
the
seafloor
establish
correspondence
between
the
backscatter
point
and
the
surface
normal
that
point
the
first
technique
uses
constraint
between
the
surface
normal
and
the
position
the
sensor
generate
partial
differential
equation
which
when
solved
generates
the
elevation
map
the
surface
the
second
technique
uses
iterative
relaxation
method
generate
the
surface
minimizing
the
difference
between
the
intensity
data
and
the
calculated
surface
intensity
this
technique
similar

from

methods
used
computer
vision
both
techniques
sparse
bathymetric
data
used
generate
initial
guess
for
the
shape
the
seafloor
and
initial
guess
for
the
scattering
model
parameters
these
techniques
are
designed
support
different
scattering
models
they
can
applied
different
underwater
environments
this
contrast
with
other
approaches
that
are
generally
less
flexible
with
respect
the
scattering
model
used
addition
the
elevation
map
the
seafloor
the
parameters
the
scattering
model
like
albedo
and
surface
roughness
every
point
the
image
are
generated
these
parameters
describe
material
properties
the
seafloor
maps
scattering
model
parameters
can
used
segment
the
seafloor
according
material
type
the
sensor
not
towed
straight
line
distortions
will
occur
the
backscatter
image
that
degrade
the
reconstruction
the
elevation
map
remove
the
effects
these
distortions
are
developing
techniques
for
incorporating
knowledge
about
the
movement
the
sensor
platform
into
the
surface
reconstruction
process
first
the
surface
reconstructed
locally
using
the
assumption
that
locally
the
sensor
moves
straight
line
then
these
local
reconstructions
are
transformed
global
coordinate
system
using
the
known
position
the
sensor
and
the
reconstruction
done
globally
all
the
data
carry
out
this
task
employ
method
for
merging
sonar
data
taken
from
different
sensor
positions
which
can
also
used
map
merging
