cimtas
are
turkish
company
involved
the
construction
industry
they
specialise
the
fabrication
and
installation
heavy
steel
structures
cranes
and
pressure
vessels
they
manufacture
the
region
tonnes
steel
structures
per
year
and
have
over
employees
the

weld
large
ibeams

have
recently
purchased
both
fanuc

the
robot
program
was
generated
entirely
using
the
teach
pendant
the
shop
floor
since
axes
are
used
can
difficult
for
the
operator
visualise
all
possible
configurations
due
the
size
the
ibeams
cimtas
have
encountered
many
problems
getting
the
robots
achieve
satisfactory
welds
without
exceeding
robot
joint
limit
having
the
welding
tool
collide
with
the
workpiece
possible
move
the
robot
and
down
along
the
vertical
track
but
only
unbolting
and
winching
into
position
this
makes
difficult

different
heights
above
the

project
aims
experiment
with
different
robot
and
table
configurations
maximise
the
work

minimise
the
possibility

when
the
robot
reorients

improve

for
the
human

need
for
teach

programming
optimise
the
robot
program
and
reduce
cycle
time
the
solution
model
the
workcell
was
created
with
workspace
and
the
srvl
and
arcmate
were
compared
for
reachability
the
workspace
facility
plot
the
working
envelope
was
used
position
the
work
piece
optimally
was
immediately
found
that
this
application
the
reis
srvl
robot
allowed
greater
working
envelope
this
robot
was
chosen
place
the
arcmate
for
the
workcell
using

was
possible
make
the
vertical
track
translational
joint
the
rotating
column
this
allowed
the
height
the
robot
optimised
simply
changing
variable
the
simulation
work
then
began
developing
set
teach
points
which
the
robot
could
follow
without
hitting
joint
limit
colliding
with
the
workpiece
was
found
that
repositioning
the
column
between
welds
enabled
several
particularly
difficult
moves
achieved
previously
cimtas
had
simply
placed
the
mechanism
that
was
right
angles
the
linear
track
for
the
duration
the
cycle
collisions
tended
arise
the
robot
was
forced
reorient
the
wrist
during
linear
move
along
welding
seam
the
simulation
highlights
any
collisions
and
allows
the
user
abandon
move
and
immediately
try
another
approach
