millions
canadians
sit
down
turkey
feast
this
holiday
season
few
will
think
about
the
life
this
bird
and
how
got
their
plate
but
the
turkeys
story
important
one
because
like
the
slaughter
the
buffalo
the
driftnetting
the
oceans
demonstrates
the
extent
which
our
society
has
removed
itself
from
nature
associate
turkeys
with
chickens
but
they
are
actually
more
closely
related
pheasants
and
partridges
the
wild
turkey
was
indigenous
what
now
the
southern
united
states
and
mexico
and
was
first
domesticated
the
people
this
region
some
years
ago
when
the
conquistadors
landed
there
the
century
they
were
introduced
the
turkey
these
indigenous
people
columbus
thought
the
first
european
see
and
eat
turkey
when
was
invited
feast
what
now
honduras
when
they
returned
europe
the
conquistadors
took
some
the
birds
with
them
and
the
meat
soon
became
popular
believed
that
the
bird
was
eventually
brought
england
merchants
trading
out
the
eastern
mediterranean
which
was
then
part
the
turkish
empire
some
think
the
turkey
may
have
got
its
name
from
these
turkish
merchants
turkeys
became
staple
english
christmas
dinners
and
when
the
virginia
colonists
crossed
the
ocean
the
early
century
they
brought
the
tradition
with
them
and
adopted
the
bird
for
thanksgiving
and
christmas
feasts
benjamin
franklin
even
wanted
the
turkey
the
united
states
national
bird
instead
the
eagle
because
was
native
every
one
the
states
the
union
the
time
back
those
precolumbian
times
more
than
ten
million
wild
turkeys
freely
roamed
the
forests
and
plains
the
southern
part
the
continent
they
lived
for
years

nuts
acorns

and

turkeys
flew
short
distances
mostly
roost
trees
but
generally
they
walked
ran
they
were
fact
one
the
fastest
birds
earth
often
reaching
speeds
kmh
but
because
habitat
loss
and
extensive
hunting
few
these
wild
turkeys
remain
today
instead
due
factory
farming
and
genetic
engineering
hundreds
millions
turkeys
live
short

with

foot
ulcerations

these

are

turkeys
are
often
debeaked
process
which
involves
slicing
off
about
onethird
the
beak
with
redhot
blade
when
the
bird
around
five
days

this
done

when
due

lack

stressinduced

studies
have
shown
that
the
pain
caused
this
procedure
prolonged
and
possibly
indefinite
far
the
biggest
innovation
turkey
production
occurred
the
when
producers
started
genetically
altering
and
selectively
breeding
turkeys
because
consumer
demand
for
more
breast

this
genetic

raises
the
question

todays
heavybreasted
turkeys
have
been
genetically
altered
for
rapid

and
weight
gain
such
extent
that
many
have
trouble
supporting
their
own

and
cant
move

the
result
lameness
and

the
leg
and
hip

the
birds
have
also
been
changed
much
that
they
can
longer
reproduce
naturally
and
artificial

has
now
become
the
sole
method

for
turkeys

the

unfortunately

however
recently

irresponsible

turkey
thanksgiving
this
did
receive
lot
media
coverage
and
rightly
provoked
much
public
concern
but
the
fact
that
these
geneticallyaltered
turkeys
had
already
received
numerous
injections
chemicals

drugs
during
production
was
lost
most
people
very
little
reported
about
these

and
how
their

might
affect

health
this
kind
urban

can
certainly
not
condoned
any
way
but
its
irony
does
show
how
far
removed
are
from
knowing
how
