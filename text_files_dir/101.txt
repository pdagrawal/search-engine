offline
programming
and
robot
calibration
the
car
industry
the
major
users
robots
have
traditionally
been
the
car
companies
whose
product
unique

starts

whose
complexity
requires
intensive
and
advanced
automation
techniques
with
short

north
america
the
big
three
car
makers
are
chrysler
ford
and
general
motors
based
detroit
and
elsewhere
the
continent
these
companies
have
spent
the
past
five
years
investing
heavily
robot
simulation
and
offline
programming
the
urgency
exerted
unexpected
demand
for
the
most
popular
models
well
large
upturn
consumer
spending
cars
has
created
pressurecooker
atmosphere
detroit
here
production
lines
are
designed
and
built
and
running
weeks
months
and
every
offline
programming
technique
examined
closely
for
potential
improvements
setup

production
rate
one
the
major
issues
here
the
move
towards
more
and
more
accurate
spot
and
arc
welding
techniques
the
car
where
every
robot
weld
within
the
intended
position
every
car
that
rolls
the
production
line
talked
kind
holy
grail
car
production
and
some
people
even
talk
hushed
tones
eventually
pushing
the
barrier
even
further
achieve
the
car
this
has
focused
attention
those
techniques
especially
robot
calibration
and
fixture
calibration
that
will
lead
higher
accuracy
offline
programming
current
practice
involves
several
stages
from
simulation
offline
programming
first
the
car
modelled
the
companywide
cad
system
often
sophisticated
mainframe
based
cad
package
like
catia
which
can
handle
models
the
complete
car
and
all
the
parts
that
make
the
car
then
the
fixtures
are
designed
which
are
present
the
parts
the
welding
robots
repeatable
and
predictable
manner
usually
requirement
that
the
fixtures
which
are
created
specialist
tooling
companies
under
contract
are
certified
this
means
that
points
the
fixture
which
are
clamp
the
part
the
blocks
against
which
the
part
are
clamped
must
measured
very
precisely
using
coordinate
measuring
device
these
measurements
are
referred
coordinate
frame
the
centreline
the
car
using
three
datum
points
the
fixture
these
three
datum
points
give
the
position
orientation
and
scaling
factor
associated
with
the
fixture
the
measurements
are
usually
recorded
using
two
manual
theodolites
and
standard
theodolite
triangulation
another
alternative
technique
that
promises
even
higher
accuracies
than
those
achieved
using
theodolites
named
photogrammetry
photogrammetry
uses
several
very
high
resolution
electronic
photographs
target
attached
the
fixture
taken
from
different
angles
together
with
standard
imageprocessing
techniques
derive
the
position
the
target
has
technique
that
has
long
been
used
terrain
mapping
using
aerial
photography
and
advanced
stereo
vision
but
only
now
finding
application
down
the
shop
floor
the
first
fixture
then
installed
the
production
line
and
from
this
the
position
the
first
robot
defined
again
using
theodolites
the
position
the
first
fixture
then
defines
the
position
the
second
fixture
and
all
the
way
down
the
production
line
the
simulation
the
robot
programmes
has
usually
been
completed
this
stage
using
models
imported
from
the
cad
system
and
offtheshelf
robot
models
purchased
from
the
simulation
vendor
more
and
more
the
simulation
functionality
available
the
cad
system
for
example
coordinate

representing
the
position
and
orientation
spotwelds
and

and

and

before
exporting
the
model
the
simulation
the
simulation
used
check
that
the
robots
can
reach
all
the
required
positions
the
wrist
joint
limits
the
robot
often
limit
the
orientations
that
are
achievable
and
the
simulation
user
must
work
creatively
position
the
robot
base
and
the
robot
tool
particular
position
and
orientation
may
not
achievable
given
robot
configuration
for
example
with
the
wrist
pointing
down
with
the
elbow
pointing
the
configuration
the
robot
model
can
changed
driving
the
robot
using
joint
motion
into
different
configuration
before
attempting
the
movement
the
simulation
enables
the
user
plan
collision
free
paths
around
the
clamps
holding
the
part
using
via
points
which
must
created
such
way
that
they
not
add
excessively
the
overall
cycle
time
this
the
reason
that
important
derive
reasonably
accurate
cycle
times
from
the
simulation
unfortunately
the
robot
companies
consider
the
motion
algorithms
used
their
robot
controllers
such
commercial
value
that
they
will
always
refuse
release
these
the
simulation
vendors
compromise
position
has
been
reached
between
the
simulation
vendors
and
the
robot
vendors
thanks
the
strong
encouragement
the
car
companies
america
and
germany
where
black
boxes
unreadable
parts
the
robot
controller
software
are
interfaced
the
robot
simulation
give
accurate
cycle
times
once
the
cycle
times
are
accurate
the
user
may
also
have
reasonable
confidence
that
the
trajectories
between
points
shown
the
simulation
are
accurate
and
therefore
that
the

the
shopfloor
downloading
the
robot

sometimes
called

from
the

the
robot

involves
taking

and
tool

files
from
the
airconditioned
offices
where
the

simulation
specialist
work
down
onto

much
harsher

unforgiving

the

here
that
most

rude

that
work

the

environment
the

seldom

the
uncertain
and
unpredictable
and
subtly
different
real
world
robots
are
designed
extremely
repeatable
but
not
all
that
accurate
repeatabilities
and
accuracies
worse
are
not
unusual
understand
the
difference
between
repeatability
and
accuracy
imagine
darts
game
the
first
player
playing
with
new
darts
and
aims
for
triple
but
instead
puts
all
the
darts
the
number
with
all
three
darts
close
together
the
darts
are
repeatable
but
not
very
accurate
the
second

player
playing
with
his
own
tried
and
tested
set
darts
throws
three
treble
his
darts
are
not
only
repeatable
but
they
are
also
accurate
increase
the
accuracy
the
robot
towards
the
same
order
its
repeatability
must
calibrated
each
robot
has
its
own
individual
signature
created
the
manufacturing
tolerances
involved
making
robots
and
the
wear
and
tear
crashing
the
robot
into

all
regular
occurrence
and
worse
this
signature
can
detected
measuring
the
coordinates
the
robot
over

positions
and
orientations
throughout
its
envelope
and
then
using

software
produce
more
accurate

the

the

used
the

for
robot

must
cheap
and
relatively
easy

suggest
that
customers

make

detroit
the

companies
will
not
spend

any

that

and
they
see
robot

the
revolutionary
technology
that
will
enable
them
build
more

quicker

lower
