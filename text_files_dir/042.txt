chaos
cool
shahriar
shahriari
many
spend
our
lives
operating
high
gear
dashing
from
one
appointment
another
grabbing
bite
eat
between
meetings
getting
stressed
traffic
jams
and
being
overwhelmed
our
workload
think
our
problem
time
the
lack
but
not
our
problem
really
lack
order
other
words
chaos
everything
were
orderly
would
have
relaxed
enjoyable
breakfast
that
would
well
digested
order
prevailed
traffic
could
calmly
find
our
place
the
rush
and
with
the
flow
without
being
obstructed
old
ladies
harassed
the
bad
taxi
drivers
our
telephone
would
ring
just
when
were
ready
accept
calls
our
email
messages
would
have
been
sorted
out
their
order
priority
and
our
coffee
break
would
exactly
thata
coffee
break
but
alas
our
world
appears
unavoidably
chaotic
and
must
negotiated
well
possible
yet
this
perspective
based
the
old
paradigm
science
and
systems
theory
tell
that
chaos
not
element
randomness
but
rather
lack
understanding
the
level
and
complexity
order
nonlinear
universe
what
call
chaos
fact
the
freedom
movement
latitude
given
the
elements
the
system
able
evolve
through
selforganization
whether
look
the
spontaneous
concentration
the
gases
around
the
denser
clouds
shortly
after
the
big
bang
the
spontaneous
evolution
the
chemical
soup
into
the
first
life
form
the
gathering
the
first
hunter
tribe
apes
form
the
first
community
humankind
see
selforganization
work
the
constantlychanging
yet
somewhat
predictable
weather
patterns
the
seeming
chaos
bee
hive
and
even
the
spontaneous
creation
political
movements
such
communism
the
reform
party
ross
perot
are
all
expressions
selforganization
work
selforganization
essential
part
and
mechanism
evolution
and
chaos
the
initial
condition
that
gives
rise
order
was
this
same
mechanism
that
created
the
civil
rights
movement
the
feminist
movement
and
the
environmental
movement
was
chaos
that
triggered
the
fall
the
berlin
wall
the
collapse
the
communist
bloc
and
the
freedom
nelson
mandela
was
also
chaos
that
brought
about
the
downfall
the
mainframe
computer
favour
the
the
resurgence
alternative
healing
against
the
institutional
medical
structures
and
the
embracing
spirituality
reaction
the
rationalistic
materialism
the
previous
era
chaos
necessary
and
chaos
good
whenever
system
has
reached
static
point
equilibrium
and
has
more
room
grow
and
evolve
fertile
ground
for
chaos
take
over
chaotic
environment
ideas
flourish
limitations
and
boundaries
dissolve
risks
are
taken
opportunities
arise
and
many
attempts
lead
failure
but
out
the
same
trials
that
eventually
one
more
attempts
evolve
the
most
likely
succeed
and
flourish
and
then
the
other
elements
within
that
stillchaotic
system
spontaneously
decide
favour
some
the
alternatives
that
are
most
likely
succeed
and
through
mechanism
selfdetermination
organize
themselves
line
with
their
chosen
paths
evolution
this
the
mechanism
selforganization
evolution
through
the
exercise
freedom
choice
often
chaos
evolves
much
better
than
order
have
all
noticed
that
when
traffic
light
out
order
there
actually
less
traffic
congestion
and
cars
move
more
quickly
and
easily
that
because
the
mind
the
selforganizing
system
takes
over
and
pushes
the
imposed
rules
aside
voting
favour
selfregulation
and
orderly
traffic
movement
following
the
same
model
many
the
forwardthinking
corporations
structured
and
hierarchical
management
with
imposed
rules
has
given
way
flat
functional
and
selfregulating
organization
the
only
problem
with
chaos
that
individuals
working
within
the
chaotic
system
have
neither
the
foresight
nor
the
insight
grasp
the
bigger
picture
are
too
involved
finding
our
way
through
the
mess
are
too
preoccupied
with
answering
that
telephone
call
avoiding
that
bad
driver
particularly
the
onset
chaotic
system
which
always
fragile
too
much
energy
seems
wasted
keep
going
back
and
forth
spinning
our
wheels
avoiding
undesirable
situations
even
trying
restore
the
status
quo
are
too
busy
addressing
our
fears
chaos
not
the
problem
either
the
problem
merely
our
perception
chaos
could
simply
see
the
usefulness
chaos
and
give
the
right
perspective
our
lives
then
could
deal
with
appropriately
without
fearing
fact
might
even
want
create
chaos
and
trust
that
the
mind
the
system
would
lead
selforganization
spontaneously
without
much
effort
our
part
and
still
the
bigger
picture
can
see
the
universe
selforganizing
system
that
has
worked
for
billions
years
without
any
help
direction
from
could
only
recognize
god
the
mind
the
universe
and
not
merely
its
creator
then
would
trust
natures
selforganization
capability
would
not
try
dominate
subjugate
would
simply
recognize
chaos
part
growth
and
very
calmly
proceed
with
our
lives
without
wasting
any
energy
our
fears
the
selforganizing
system
our
universe
the
gaia
humanity
our
country
and
even
our
