healing
comes
its
own
time
rick
gossett
earlier
cultures
the
shaman
was
usually
present
the
death
individual
help
their
soul
move
heaven
the
valhallah
the
light
whatever
the
other
side
was
perceived
was
time
healing
for
the
family
and
community
and
process
now
referred
psychopomp
unfortunately
our
modern
culture
people
die
and
there
such
spirit
work
done
the
family
often
spread
out
over
the
country
and
they
may
not
even
gather
for
the
funeral
yet
the
work
there
souls
that
are
either
confused
obstinate
have
unfinished
business
not
move
the
spirit
world
the
following
two
examples
demonstrate
the
significance
this
kind
work
man
from
mentor
group
seattle
was
called
malaysia
where
huge
clothing
store
had
collapsed
killing
hundreds
people
however
returned
from
his
trip
looking
very
puzzled
had
not
been
able
find
very
many
souls
our
group
contributed
this
the
fact
that
malaysia
had
culture
which
took
care
this
kind
work
but
the
news
later
reported
the
loss
only
six
lives
the
rest
the
bodies
were
store
dummies
the
second
example
involves
grandmother
who
died
last
month
very
angry
and
bitter
woman
she
was
estranged
from
her
family
had
only
met
her
few
times
had
grief
sense
loss
her
passing
yet
felt
compelled
something
the
time
her
funeral
which
was
being
held
another
part
the
country
journeyed
and
asked
totems
take
her
spirit
knowing
that
she
was
probably
still
around
when
found
her
she
was
angry
that
couldnt
get
close
her
not
knowing
what
else
began
sing
her
she
stopped
her
raging
and
looked
seeing
for
the
first
time
mind
said
that
were
family
that
shared
the
same
genes
but
that
went
deeper
than
that
she
was
good
woman
who
had
had
bad
life
and
cared
for
her
saw
her
soul
that
soul
part
though
attenuated
her
looked
back
and
responded
this
point
the
journey
face
was
wet
with
tears
held
out
hands
her
and
she
came
she
came
large
heavy
cloak
dropped
away
from
her
she
was
young
again
and
smiling
still
singing
turned
her
towards
the
light
just
before
she
went
into
she
turned
and
threw
back
several
things
they
fluttered
and
were
gone
she
smiled
again
and
said
dont
really
need
those
and
they
are
not
mine
anyway
then
she
was
gone
they
had
been
soul
parts
that
she
had
stolen
they
were
now
free
return
those
whom
they
belonged
the
light
expanded
did
the
joy
heart
returned
from
journey

that

its
own
