introduction
during

the

been
characterized

the
twenty
first

and
global
scale
never
before
possible
the
public
square
the
past
with
pamphleteering
soap
boxes
and
vigorous

being
replaced
the
internet
which
enables
average
citizens

national
discourse

distribute
electronic
pamphlet
the
world
and
generally
communicate
and
with
broader
audience
than
ever
before
possible
also
enables

literally
worldwide

the
act

first
attempt

this
promising
new
medium
unfortunately
congress
undertook
this
task
without
holding
any
hearings
regarding
the
likely
impact
the
cda
that
medium
the
name
protecting
children
from
inappropriate
material
they
might
encounter
online
congress
clumsily
attempted
graft
regulations
developed
the
dialaporn
context
onto
this
very
different
indeed
unique
mode
communication
after
making
precisely
the
kind
inquiry
congress
failed
make
that
undertaking
five
days
evidentiary
hearings
and
considering
massive
amounts
documentary
evidence
including
extensive
stipulated
facts
the
threejudge

preliminarily

that

jurisdictional
statement
app
the
district
court
unanimously
held
that
appellees
are
likely
succeed
their
claim
that
this
ban
violates
the
first
amendment
that
judgment
was
clearly
correct
nevertheless
appellees
appreciate
that
this
case
raises
important
constitutional
questions
regarding
the
application
traditional
first
amendment
principles
new
and
increasingly
important
medium
communication
and
therefore
recognize
that
the
court
likely
grant
plenary
review
regardless
the
strength
the
district
courts
decision
although
believe
the
judgment
below
could
summarily
affirmed
understand
that
this
case
first
impression
the
court
may
prefer
engage
more
comprehensive
examination
this
new
medium
and
the
extensive
record
compiled
below
agree
that
the
circumstances
this
case
plenary
review
may
appropriate
even
believe
the
judgment
below
plainly
correct
accordingly
not
oppose
the
governments
request
for
plenary
review
however
believe
particularly
important
this
case
first
impression
that
the
court
have
clear
understanding
precisely
what
was
argued
and
decided
below
for
example
the
government
did
not
argue
below
apparently
does
here
that
sections
and
the
cda
criminalize
indecent
patently
offensive
speech
only
when
the
speaker
knows
that
the
only
recipients
the
speech
are
all
under
years
age
moreover
the

jurisdictional

frequently
ignores
dispositive

the

does
not
argue

erroneous

the

critical
factual
findings
that
impossible
infeasible
for
most

comply
with
the
cdas
affirmative
defenses
because
the
global
nature
the

the
cda
will
not
effectively
shield

from

patently
offensive

since
very
substantial

what

these
findings
undergird
the
district

legal
conclusions
that
the

effectively
bans
constitutionally

among

would
not
substantially
further
the

and

serve
the

impossibility
and

compliance
the
district
court
received
extensive
evidence
from
numerous
experts
and
other
witnesses
and
carefully
considered
the
different
methods
communication
over
the
internet
based
this
body
evidence
the
court
made
its
general
factual
finding
that
once
provider
posts
content

internet
available
all
other
internet
users
worldwide
app
for
most
methods
communication
over
the

the
court
concluded
that
simply
not
possible
for
speaker
restrict

for
example
the
district
court
specifically
considered
the
ability
speaker
posting

newsgroup
comply
with
the
cda
the
court
found
that
messages
newsgroups
are
disseminated
using

peer
peer
connections
between
approximately
computers
called
usenet
servers
around
the
world
app
and
that
the
dissemination
messages
usenet
servers
around
the
world
automated
process
that
does
not
require
direct
human
intervention
review
because
this
structure
the
court
found
fact
that
once
user
posts
message
newsgroup
that
message
becomes
available
all
subscribers
that
newsgroup
bulletin
board
the
court
below
found
content
posted
newsgroups
available
not
just
philadelphia
but
also
provo
and
prague
the
court
specifically
further
found
that
individuals
posting
message
newsgroup
cannot
ensure
that
all
readers
are
adults
emphasis
added
noting
that
even
the
governments
expert
agreed
with
that
factual
conclusion
the
district
court
reached
the
same
conclusions
about
email

exploders
also
known
listservs

the

the
district
court
specifically
noted
that
even
the

expert
witness
agreed
that
current
technology
could
give
speaker
assurance
that
only
adults
were
listed
particular
mail
exploders
mailing
list
with
newsgroups
and
mail
exploders
the
court
based
its
finding
that
individuals
engaging
chat
room
discussions
cannot
ensure
that
all
readers
are
adults
part
the
fact
that
the
governments
expert
agreed
similarly
with
muds
and
muses
the
court
found
fact
that
participants
not
know
whether
the
other
participants
are
adults
minors
with
respect
the
world
wide
web
which
one
method
communication
the

the
court
found
that
unlike

the
internet
app
there
does
exist
technology
which
operator
world
wide
web
server
may
interrogate
user
web
site
using
computer
program
called
cgi
script
the
court
found
fact
however
that
content
providers
who
publish
the
world
wide
web
via
the
large
commercial
online
services
cannot
use
cgi
scripts
for
those

the

there
method
currently
available

the
court
concluded
that
all

advanced

government
below
are
effectively
unavailable
for

and
these
entities
constitute
the

the
cda
the
district
court
similarly
considered
the
adult

defense
and
found
fact
that
the
burdens
imposed
credit
card
verification
and
adult
password
verification
systems
make
them
effectively
unavailable
substantial
number
internet

finally
the
district

found
fact
that
the

would
not
allow

that

who

for

they
would
have

that

their

the

the

claimed

the
court
found
that
large

perhaps
more

originates
outside

app
and
some

the

manner

would
have
unfettered
access
all

thus

finally
the

concerning

methods
which
parents
can
easily
and
inexpensively
prevent
their
children
from
accessing
indecent
patently
offensive
online
content
even
posted
overseas
the
court
identified
many
different
and
currently
available
software
programs
that
allow
parents
limit
the

access
their

app
similarly
the
court
found
that
the
major
online

all
offer
extensive
options
allow
parents
control
what
their
children
can
access
given
these
factual
findings
which
the
government
has
not

clear
that
the

correctly
held
that

their
claim
that
the
challenged
provisions
the

violate
the
first

argument
the

preliminary

because
the

has
not

which
that

based
and
does
not
ask
the

overrule
the
longestablished
first
