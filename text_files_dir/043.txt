arisen
due

not
surprisingly
therefore
airlines
outside

lyle
believes
there

the

are
seeing
the
beginning
the
end
the
travel
agent
lyle
thinks
this
seems
unlikely
first
travel
agents
provide
much
broader
and
often
much
more
personalised
service
passengers
than
the
airlines
directly
they
are
not
tied
individual
supplier
and
offer
expert
and
hopefully
impartial
advice
different
carriers
fares
and
routings
different
hotels
and
different

companies
just
name
few
products
and
agents
can
themselves
offer
benefits

thus
there
reason
why

consequently
while
there
