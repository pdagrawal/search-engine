recover
from
the
defendant
negligence
person
negligent
she
fails
act
reasonable
person
would
act
similar
situation
examples
negligence
include
inattentive
driving
that
causes
automobile
accident
store
owner
failing
repair
defective
escalator
that
causes
fall
reasonable
person
would
have
driven

reasonable
store
owner
would
have
fixed
the
unsafe

the
person
who
drove
inattentively
failed
make
repairs
could
found
negligent
judge
jury
negligent
behavior
almost
never
criminal
intentional
misconduct
intentional
misconduct
occurs
when
someone
acting
deliberately
does
something
that
hurts
another
person
damages
that
persons
property
the
law
does
not
require
that
the
person
intend
cause
the
injury
she
actually
inflicts
only
that
she
acted
deliberately
with
complete
indifference
toward
persons
own
safety
the
safety
others
for
example
driver
automobile
may
intend
only
scare
pedestrian
swerving
toward
the
pedestrian
but
the
driver
hits
the
pedestrian
the
driver
commits
intentional
misconduct
intentional
misconduct
can
more
difficult
prove
than
negligence
but
often
plaintiff
can
recover
greater
damages
she
can
show
the
defendant
acted
intentionally
intentional
misconduct
often
criminal
behavior
also
examples
intentional
misconduct
include
assault
and
battery
strict
liability
some
situations
plaintiff
can
recover
for
injuries
received
even
the
defendant
uses
utmost
care
these
situations
defendant
said
strictly
absolutely
liable
for
any
damages
resulting
from
his
her
actions
the
principle
behind
strict
liability
that
some
activities
are
necessary
but
dangerous
that
even
reasonable
person
cannot
make
them
completely
safe
social
policy
defendants
are
permitted
engage
certain
activities
but
are
held
strictly
liable
for
any
injury
resulting
from
the
activity
strict
liability
claims
most
commonly
result
from
extremely
dangerous
activities
such
blasting
excavating
demolishing
building
from
defective
products
comparative

law
attempts
compensate
victims
their
injuries
are
caused
another
person
when
one
person
clearly
causes
all
another
persons
injury
blame
easy
place
many
other
cases
however
the
victims
actions
help
cause
the
injury
make
worse
than
would
otherwise
for
instance
negligent
driver
might
injure
pedestrian
who
negligently
walking

prudent
pedestrian
normally

person
injured
defective

may
have
suffered
more
severe
injuries
negligently
failing
wear
safety
goggles
while
using
the
chain
saw
these
cases
judge
jury
must
calculate
how
much
each
party
fault
each
state
has
its
own
rules
for
calculating
damages
that
can
recovered
when
victim
least
partially
blame
for
his
her
own
injury
illinois
has
comparative
fault
rule
under
the
comparative
fault
rule
judge
reduces
the
amount
any
damage
award
the
percent
that
the
victims
own
actions
contributed
his
her
injuries
for
example
jury
finds
that
plaintiff
suffered
damages
but
was
percent

the
judge
reduces
the
damage
award
percent
the
reduction
may
made
only
percent
the
victim
more
than
percent
fault
she
collects
nothing
vicarious
liability
there
are
several
ways
person
can
held
liable
for
the
actions
another
person
this
known
vicarious
liability
for
example
parent
might
held
responsible
for
damage
caused
his
her
child
the
parent
knows
that
the
child
likely
injure
someone
the
parent
has
the
ability
control
the
child
and
the
parent
negligently
fails
exercise
any
control
over
the
child
the
owner
vehicle
can
held
responsible
for
accidents
caused
when
another
person
drives
the
vehicle
the
owner
negligently
entrusts
the
vehicle
the
other
driver
the
most
common
form
vicarious
liability
called
respondeat

responsible
for

committed
employees
within

their

business
owner
not
usually
responsible
for
acts
committed
independent

for
example
pedestrian

person
driving
party
the
victim
has
claim
against
the
driver
the
pedestrian
hit
person
driving
delivery
van
for
his
her
employer
then
respondeat
superior
gives
the
pedestrian
claims
against
both
the
driver
and
the
employer
practical
matter
personal

high

then

practicing

personal

generally
fall
into
one

practice
areas
product
liability

and
workers

product
liability
injuries
resulting
from
defective

are
the

some
personal

lawsuits
frequently
receive
attention
the

stories
people
recovering

for

all
make
headlines

sometimes

share
legal
costs
and
split
any

product
liability
claims
usually
rely
one
three
theories
strict
liability
negligence
breach
warranty
each
these
has
its
standards
and
potential
damages
often
single
injury
leads
plaintiff
bring
claims
under
all
three
theories
against
the
manufacturer
for
example
person
injured
when
microwave
oven
explodes
might
allege
that
the
ovens
manufacturer
breached
warranty
negligently
manufactured
the
oven
and
that
the
oven
was
dangerous
that
its
manufacturer
should
held
strictly
liable
for
all
injuries
caused
strict
product
liability
strict
liability
makes
the
manufacturer
product
liable
someone
injured
while
using
the
product
the
product
was
unreasonably
dangerous
this
theory
focuses
the
product
itself
illinois
person
alleging
strict
product
liability
must
show
that
the
product
was
defective
condition
that
was
unreasonably
dangerous
even
used
for
its
intended
purpose
the
defect
existed
when
the
product
left
the
manufacturers
control
the
defect
caused
the
plaintiffs
injury
for
example
chair
had
defective
leg
that
made
unsafe
sit
the
leg
was
defective
when
the
chair
left
the
manufacturer
and
that
weak
leg
caused

who
fell
after

manufacturing
the
product
all
negligence
cases
the
manufacturer
can
found
liable
judge
jury
finds
that
the
manufacturer
failed
exercise
the
degree
care
that
reasonable
manufacturer
would
exercise
manufacturing
the
product
that
the
product
was
not
manufactured
according
the
manufacturers
own
specifications
under
this
theory
the
manufacturer
the
faulty
chair
might
liable
the
company
did
not
conduct
reasonable
inspections
ensure
that
products
were
checked
for
defects
before
being
sold
consumers
important
note
that
the
manufacturer
not
negligent
merely
for
failing

perfectly
safe

illinois
courts
use
reasonable
care
balancing
test
that
asks
jurors
balance
the
likelihood
and
seriousness

against
the
feasibility
and
burden
possible
precautions
that
might
have
avoided
the
harm
for
example
manufacturers
might
not
required
install
safety
feature
doing
would
make
the
product
prohibitively
expensive
impossible
use
these
cases
the
manufacturer
has
duty
warn
users
the
product
the
risks
associated
with
its
use
that
users
can
protect
themselves
this
why
ladders
for

have
many
warnings

assault
and
battery
many
people
believe
that
assault
and
battery
are
one
action
they
are
actually
two
closely
related
but
distinct
actions
assault
the
attempt
threat
inflict
injury
another
person
when
coupled
with
the
apparent
ability
carry
out
the
attempt
threat
assault
does
not
require
actual
physical
contact
for
example
someone
threatens
strike
neighbor
and
appears
capable
carrying
out
the
threat
the
person
making
the
threat
may
liable
for
assault
even
though
she
never
touches
the
neighbor
battery
similar
assault
but
requires
actual
unwelcome
physical
contact
the
physical
contact
need
not
strong
injure
the
other
person
for
example
person
can
commit
battery
touching
another

illinois
merchants
are
not

the

longer
than
reasonable
necessary
under

circumstances
beyond
the

the

may
liable

landowner
liability
there
are
several
ways
landowner
may
liable
someone
injured
the
landowners
property

owners
may

they
something

sometimes
sued
for

caused
people
committing
crimes
his
her

the
business
owner
did
not
take
appropriate
measures
ensure
the
safety
customers
example
this
type
case
occurs
when
person
attacked
parking
lot
and
then
sues
the
lots
owner
for
failing
provide
security
measures
that
could
have
prevented
the
attack
general
landowner
not
liable
for
the
injuries
trespasser
however
the
landowner
must
take
reasonable
care
protect
the
people
she
knows
come
the
property
for
legitimate
purposes
such
letter
carriers
landowner
may
responsible
children
injured
his
her
property
there
something
the
property
like
swimming
pool
that
dangerous
the
children
are
likely
exercise
less
care
than
adults
and
the
landowner
fails
exercise
sufficient
care
prevent
injury
reasonable
child
other
states
place
greater
liability
landowners
this

through
what
commonly

doctrine
illinois
does
not

without

compensation
system
workers
injured
the
job
would
have
prove
that
their
employers
negligence
led
the
injury
because
the
system
does
not
require
proving
negligence
worker
injured
the
job
has
better
chance
being
compensated
than
she
injured
some
other
way
and
has
file
civil
lawsuit
instead
filing

worker
notifies
her
employer
the
injury
and
the
employer
then
contacts
its
insurance
carrier
which
handles
payment
any
medical
bill
and
other
claims
made
the
employee
all
employers

the
illinois
workers

the

the
tradeoff
for
this
relatively
easy
route
compensation
limit
the
amount
money
that
can
awarded
for
workrelated

with
few
exceptions
employers
their
insurers
are
only

sometimes
